The antifertility and anticancer activities were studied in greater details. The effects of the different doses of the aqueous extract of the seeds on the pregnancy of mice revealed that when given subcutaneously as a single dose prior to mating did not prevent conception but adversely affected the foetal development. Subcutaneously the LD B11100B11 was found to be 2 mg/kg, while 0.5 mg/kg was non toxic. Oral administration of 25 mg/kg of the extract caused death in 40 per cent of the animals (Desai and Sirsi, 1964). The aqueous suspension of the seeds was found to cause abortion 51 per cent of rats when administered orally at the daily dose of 125 mg/kg from day 0 to 10 of post coital period. The abortifacient activity was found to be reduced when the same dose was administered from day 6 to day 15. In failure cases (where pregnancy was not interrupted) noticeable neonatal anomalies were observed (Sethi et al., 1990). The petroleum ether and alcoholic extracts of the root on oral administration from 1-5d post coitum prevented nidation up to 100 per cent in albino rats. The alcoholic extract of the drug also showed antioestrogenic activity when injected simultaneously with oestradiol. The LD B1150B11 of the drug was found to be 2g/kg (Agarwal et al., 1970). The ethanolic extract of the air-dried powdered seeds in a concentration of 1 mg/ml/day up to 12d administered intraperitoneally exhibited antispermatogenic activity in albino rats. Oral administration of a 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the seeds (250 mg/kg) for 30 and 60d induced a total infertility in male albino rats. A protein extract isolated from the seeds showed antitumour activity on Yoshida sarcoma (solid and ascites forms) in rats and a fibro sarcoma in mice. The aqueous extract of the seeds when tested against Ehrlichâs ascites carcinoma in transplanted mouse tumours for anticancer activity was toxic and all the experimental animals died before the experiment was completed at the test doses of 3 and 12mg/kg i.p. (Pal et al., 1968). Preliminary investigations of the water soluble portion of the 90 per cent ethanolic extract of the seed kernels at a dose of 0.05-0.25 mg/ml showed spasmodic effect on different smooth muscles of rabbit, guinea pig, albino rat and dog. The extract was well tolerated up to a dose of 1.5 g/kg orally and did not produce any toxic effects (Agrawal et al., 1971). The alcoholic extracts of the seed kernel was devoid of cardiovascular actions in dogs, showed CNS depressant and analgesic activity in rats, spasmogenic effect on isolated uterine strip of guinea pig and rat, slight relaxant effect of the rat uterus in diestrous cycle, reversible relaxant effect on rabbit ileum. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant (excluding root) in a biological screening was found to be devoid of various activities viz., antiviral, antifertility, hypoglycaemic, diuretic and antiinflammatory as well as effects on isolated ileum, CNS and gross behavioural effect. The chemical and pharmacological studies on the plant were reviewed by Khan et al., (1991). The ethanolic extract of the seeds inhibited the growth of I11Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphiI11 A and B, I11Shigella dysenteriae I11 Sonne and Schmitzii, enteric microorganisms and pathogenic fungi I11Trichophyton interdigitale, T. rubrumI11 and I11Epidermophyton floccosumI11 in vitro. Both aqueous and ethanolic extracts were not inhibitory to I11Microsporum canis, Candida albicans, AspergilliI11 and I11Mycobacterium tuberculosisI11 H B1137B11R B11v.B11The alcoholic extract of the seeds showed slight antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli in vitro. The alcoholic extract of the seeds at a concentration of 200 mg/ ml was found to be active against I11Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 and I11Escherichia coliI11 while the hexane and the aqueous extracts were devoid of any activity. The extract of the seeds in vitro studies was found to be fungistatic at 1 per cent concentration against I11Cryptococcus neoformansI11 isolated from the brain lesion of a patient. The 80 per cent ethanolic extract of the leaves showed antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 at a concentration of 25 mg/ml using the agar dilution method. The extract, however, was inactive against I11Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 and I11Bacillus subtilis.I11 Different fractions of the seeds showed poor anthelmintic activity against earthworms as compared to hexylresorcinol, except the aqueous extract prepared by infusion which at a concentration of 0.1 per cent was found to kill all the worms in 3 min. The extract prepared by boiling the drug in water showed no activity indicating the active principal was heat labile (Agarwal, 1975). The cold alcoholic extract of seeds showed toxicity against I11Dactynotus carthamiI11 while it was inactive against I11Prodenia litura.I11 The aqueous extracts of the seeds exhibited striking effects on the mitotic and meiotic chromosomes in the testes of the grasshopper Poecilocerus pictus. Abrine, isolated from the seeds, in a dose of 5-20 ppm had a drastic effect on the population density of mealy bugs I11Maconellicoccus hirsutus.I11 The aqueous extract of unprocessed and processed (milk as well as âkanji shodhitâ) white, red and brown varieties of seeds in a doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg administered i.p. in albino mice were studied for their effects on CNS, besides acute toxicity. The animals fed with the unprocessed seeds in different doses showed depression on CNS activity, marked decrease in heart and respiratory rates, sluggish spontaneous activity and reactivity, elongation of the body, aggressive behaviour and coloration of skin from white to black. However, animals treated with milk processed material also showed lesser aforesaid changes but almost no change was observed in âkanji shodhitâ material. Acute toxicity studies of processed and unprocessed seeds revealed the LD B1150B11 to be 0.5 to 1.0 mg and LDB11100B11 between 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg bw in white and red variety of the unprocessed material with both milk and âkanjiâ. The LDB1150B11 was 1.0 to 20. mg in milk and 20.0-30.0 mg/kg bw in âkanji shodhitâ seeds while LD50 was 2.5-5.0 mg/kg bw in milk and 20.0-30.0 mg/kg bw in âkanji shodhitâ seeds while LDB11100B11 was 2.5-5.0 mg/kg bw in milk and 20.0-30.0mg/kg bw in âkanji shodhitâ seeds of white and red forms, respectively (Singh Gautam et al., 1999).

The leaves, stem and root also furnished the above bases in varying proportions. A special feature was the occurrence of trigonelline as the gallic acid ester (Ghosal and Dutta, 1971). Preliminary studies of the stem, seeds, leaves and dehisced empty fruits of the plant revealed alkaloids in the stem and dehisced empty fruits and alkaloids and flavonoids in the seeds. The leaves did not have any alkaloids, flavonoids or saponins. The root contained sterol and terpenes. The flavones identified in the seeds were abrectorin (6, 4â âdimethoxy-7,3â âdihydroxflavone) (Bhardwaj et al., 1980) and premtorin (6,7,4â-trimethoxy -3â-hydroxyflavone ). Besides these, a glycoside, desmethoxycentuareidin 7- I11OI11-rutinoside and two novel flavone C-glycosides, abrusin (8-C- glucosyl scuteralein 6, 7 âdimethyl ether ) and its 2â - I11OI11- apioside and n-hentriacontane, pentacosanoic acid, Ã -amyrin, Ã -sitosterol, campesterol and a new compound identified as 7,9,15-trimethylehenicosane were isolated (Bhaumik, 1987).

The petroleum ether extracts showed antiestrogenic activity when given with standard ethinyl estradiol, while the ethanolic extract was devoid of any activity in combination. The chloroform and distilled water extracts were found to be ineffective. The infusion of the leaves showed a positive inotropic and chronotropic activities on the frog rectus abdominis.

Asarone seems to be the active principle of the rhizome. It seems to be a sedative tranquilizer with no anticonvulsant action. It has prominent antispasmodic and antiinflammatory effects besides antimicrobial, insecticidal and pesticidal actions also. The active principle responsible for the activity resided in the hydrocarbon fraction of the oil or in an oxygenated component out of various fractions of the oil tested. Acute toxicity studies with the Indian oil in mice revealed a LDB1150B11 of 0.177g/kg i.p. The steam volatile fractions of the root and rhizome prolonged the sleeping time in mice with pentobarbital, hexobarbital and ethanol. Studies on the vitro effect of the steam volatile oil on the respiration of rat brain revealed that in inhibited the oxygen uptake of brain tissues of varying degrees. The ED B1150B11 was 1:1, 980. The rate of oxygen uptake a different intervals by 100 mg of the rat brain homogenate in the presence of glucose, sodium glutamate and sodium succinate was 43.1, 34.1 and 6.7 per cent, respectively. Neuropharmacological actions of the oil (from the rhizome) revealed sedative-tranquilizing action in rats, mice, cats, dogs and forced motor activities in mice. Acorus oil investigated for its antianaleptic activity was used as a saline suspension, given 1h prior to production of convulsions in adult albino mice. At a dose of 100 mg/kg bw i.p. it successfully prevented seizures (70 per cent) in maximal electroshock seizures. The EDB1150B11 of the test drug was found to be 60.5 mg/kg bw i.p. Asarone and Ã-asarone possessed many pharmacodynamical actions quite similar to some of the well established tranquilizers. Intraperitoneal administration of a flavone (15 mg/kg in alkalinated aqueous solution) isolated from the chloroform extract of the rhizome produced profound behavioural changes in Rhesus monkey. The chloroform extracted flavone exhibited an activity similar to I11Cannabis indica.I11 The water soluble dried powder of the alcoholic extract of the root and rhizome at 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. did not afford protection to strychnine-induced convulsions. The aqueous and alcoholic extracts of the rhizome were found to reduce the severity of maximum electric shock-induced seizures in rats but did not exhibit complete protection. The antiinflammatory activity of the boiled coconut oil extract of the rhizome was studied in rats using acute and chronic experimental models. The oral administration of 2 ml of the extract produced 45 per cent inhibition of the carrageenin-induced paw oedema, 13.6 per cent inhibition of cotton pellet granuloma formation and 61 per cent of inhibition of croton oil granuloma pouch inflammatory response in rats. The extract of the rhizome (0.5ml/kg i.p.) had significant antiinflammatory activity in acute, chronic and immunological models of inflammation and it compared well with the reference drugs (viz., hydrocortisone, phenylbutazone, flurbiprofen and cyproheptadine) in the doses used. The oil obtained from the rhizome possessed carminative properties. In moderate doses the oil produced antispasmodic action on the involuntary muscle tissue, inhibiting the excessive peristaltic movements of the intestines in rabbits and dogs. The alcoholic extract of the root and rhizome of the plant in experimental animals revealed potent sedative and analgesic properties. The essential oil and the crude alcoholic and aqueous extracts obtained from the rhizome and root showed depressant action in dogs. Asarone and the essential oil (from the rhizome) had a relaxant effect as well as antispasmodic effect against various spasmogens on the ileum of rabbit, guinea pig and albino rat, rats uterus, bronchial muscles of guinea pig, tracheal chain of dog and blood vascular muscles of rats. The essential oil of the rhizome was found to exhibit quinidine â like activity in combating auricular fibrillation (induced by either acetylcholine or aconitine), auricular flutter (produced by crush-stimulation procedure) and ventricular arrhythmias following 2-stage coronary ligation in dogs. Both asarone and Ã -asarone showed cardiac depressant activity as seen on frog and rabbit heart perfusion experiments. Ã -asarone appeared to be more potent than asarone. The 50 per cent alcoholic extract of the root exhibited a dose-dependent hypotensive action on dog blood pressure. In a preliminary biological screening, the 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the rhizomes showed antispasmodic activity on isolated guinea pig ileum and gross behavioural effect, hypothermia and analgesic activity in mice. The alcoholic, ether, acetate buffer and dilute sulphuric acid extract of the root showed activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus.I11 The alcoholic extract of the root showed marked antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus citreus, Bacillus megaterium, Salmonella paratyphiI11 A and B,I11Salm marcescens, Proteus vulgarisI11 and I11Shigella dysomei.I11 The total extract of the rhizome exhibited moderate antibacterial activity in vitro against I11Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Strept viridans, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salm paratyphiI11 A and B I11Shigella flexneri.I11 The effect was evident more against gram positive organisms than the gram negative organisms. The 80 per cent ethanolic extract of the root inhibited the two strains of I11Bacillus subtilisI11 and I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 at a concentration of 25 mg/ml using the agar diffusion method. The acetone extract of the rhizome had antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 and I11Klebsiella sp.I11 (Rajendhran et al., 1998). The ether extract of the rhizome in in vitro studies using the disc diffusion method revealed antibacterial activity against enteropathogenic I11Escherichia coliI11 (1.0), I11Shigella sonneiI11 (0.9), I11Salmonella typhiI11 (0.7), I11Klebsiella pneumoniaeI11 (2.2) and I11Vibrio choleraeI11 (2.0). The figures in the brackets indicated the zone of inhibition (in cms). The extract using the tube dilution method at a concentration of 125?g/ml (MIC 1:8) revealed antibacterial activity against I11Klebsiella pneumoniaeI11 and I11Vibrio choleraeI11 while it inhibited other organisms at a dose of 250?g/ml (MIC 1:4). The essential oil from the rhizome showed a week antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhosumI11 and I11Shigella flexneri.I11 The essential oil also showed in vitro antifungal activity against I11Aspergillus oryzae, A. nidulans, A. fumigates, Penicillium aculeatumI11 and I11Phomopsis destuctumI11 (Alankarao and Rajendra Prasad, 1981); citrus decay pathogens I11Penicillium digitatum, P. italicum, Diplodia natalensis, Alternaria tenuisI11 and I11Candida albicans, Epidermophyton cresensI11 and I11Microsporum gypseumI11 (Kapil et al., 1983). The alcoholic extract of the root showed antifungal activity against I11Aspergillus niger, Penicillium seleniumI11 and yeast Saccharomyces. The alcoholic extract of the rhizome exhibited potent antiviral in vitro against herpes virus HSV-1 and HSV-2 at a concentration well below the cytotoxic concentration. Pretreatment of Vero cells with 15Âµ/ml of the extract did not inhibit viral replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 signifying that host cells were not affected by the extract. B-Asarone had strong inhibitory activity against the replication of both virus types although the effective concentration was only two fold less than the cytotoxic concentration level. The antiherpes factor not toxic to the host cells existed both in the crude alcoholic extract of the plant as well as Ã -asarone. The alcoholic extract of the rhizomes showed in vitro anthelmintic activity against human I11Ascaris lumbricoides.I11 The essential oil obtained from the root and rhizome showed nematicidal activity against I11Meloidogyne incognitaI11 at a concentration of 250-500 ppm. The oil obtained from the rhizomes of the plant collected from Jammu revealed 100 per cent insecticidal activity, against houseflies I11Musca domesticaI11 after 12 min. The powdered rhizome was found to be useful against bugs, moths, lice, etc. The insecticidal activity and other pharmacological activities of the plant have been reviewed by Virmani et al. (1977), Hussain and Jahan (1980). C11Clinical StudiesC11 In a preliminary clinical trial on 15 patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma, 1 to 2 g of fresh root divided in three doses was administered by chewing method for 2-4wk. The drug was found to have antiasthmatic potential free from side effects. In another clinical trial on 147 children (age 5-11 years) having round worms infestation, calamus powder 250 mg t.i.d was given for three days. 122 patients (83 per cent) were completely cured while 25 patients (17 per cent) remained unchanged. The drug was found to be effective in the improvement of chest pain, dyspnoea on effort, reduction of body weight index, improving in ECG, decreasing serum cholesterol, decreasing SLDL (serum low density lipoproteins) and increasing SHDL (serum high density lipoproteins). I11A. calamusI11 (500 mg in a dose of 2 tablets three times a day after meal with water) given for six weeks showed reduction in the degree of severity of depression and better rehabilitation.

The Indian oil differed from the commercial varieties of calamus oil in respect of predominance of asarone (82 percent). The commercial varieties contained 7 per cent of asarone. The oils obtained from the plants of different parts of India were analyzed by various workers for their chemical constituents. The unpeeled dry root from Coimbatore contained 1.5-3.5 per cent of the oil. The oil obtained from the rhizome from Bangalore calamenenol (5.0 per cent), calameone (1.0 per cent), S224 pinene and camphene (0.2 per cent), eugenol (0.3 per cent) and eugenol methyl ether (1.0 per cent). The characteristic odour of the oil was ascribed to an unidentified constituent (Kelkar and Sanjiva Rao, 1934). Later, presence of Ã âasarone in the oil was also reported. The essential oil was found to be an allyetrimethoxybenzene. Dandiya et al., (1959a) carried out a comparative study of the physical characteristics and properties of the oils obtained from an Indian calamus, oil obtained from a European drug and the oil from a commercial source. The European oil had a lower specific gravity, higher optical rotation and a lower refractive index than the other two samples of the oil. Fractionation of the active substance from the volatile oil of the Indian origin by gas chromatography resulted in the isolation of S224 âasarone and Ã- asarone which are the trans- and cis-isomers , respectively of 2,4,5- trimethoxy-1-propenylbenzene (Baxter et al., 1960). The synthesis of asarone from 1, 2, 4-trimethoxybenzene was reported. Chromatographic estimation of asarones in the root oil of a tetraploid variety from Jammu was carried out (Chopra et al., 1965). The oil distilled from rhizome obtained from Kashmir was found to contain in addition to asarone, palmitic acid, calamene, calamenone, calamol, azulenen and hydrocarbons. The oil obtained from the rhizome of the plants growing in Jammu region generally had similar composition. The difference in two oils reported was that the predominant constituent in the oil from the Jammu side was asarone content was found to be only 5.20per cent. Asarone, Ã -asarone, calamenol, calamene, calamene, calamenone, eugenol, methyl eugenol, S224 -pinene, two selinane type sesquiterpenes â acolamone and isoacolamone, sugars, glucosides-acorin, calameon, calamusenone, a flavone-leteolin-6, 8-C-diglucoside, new natural products acoramone, asarylaldehyde, carcinogen, Ã -asarone and epoxyisoacoragermacrone are the main chemical constituents reported from this plant. Essential oil from rhizome, calamus oil has Ã -asarone as major constituent together with calammen, calamenol and calameon. Dry rhizome contains a yellow aromatic volatile oil. Glucoside acorin. Leaves contain oxalic acid and calcium. A rapid and accurate method using HPTLC has been developed which could be used for detection, monitoring and quantification of Ã âasarone in the plant and other herbal preparations containing the plant. The proposed method is reported to be precise (average recovery = 99.6 per cent, C.V. < 0.5 per cent), sensitive, specific and reproducible. A thin layer chromatographic technique has also been described to detect the presence of the plant in various Ayurvedic preparations. The essential oil of the rhizome and leaves raised under submountain and Tarai region of Kumaun of Uttar Pradesh, now Uttranchal, and the oil from the rhizome of Bhimtal sample (in the Kumaun hills) contained (per cent) I11pI11- cymene (0.03, 0.23,-), 1,8- cineol/limonene (traces, 3.01, 0.09), dipentene (0.37, traces, 0.06), methyleugenol ( traces, 2.05), isoeugenol (25.02, traces, 2.28), methylisoeugenol (2.79, traces), calamene (3.84, traces, 5.07), asaronaldehyde (5.66, 4.95, traces), asarone (3.95, 3.84, 4.39), Ã âasarone (42.47, oils, respectively. The physico âchemical properties of the oils were also determined. The rhizome of the plants growing in Himalayan foothills especially around Haldwani yielded an oil (4.5 per cent) which on GC âMS examination revealed the presence of 8 known compounds viz., 1,8-cineole (0.19 per cent), linalool (0.19 per cent), terpinolene (0.19 per cent), S224 â terpineol (0.09 per cent), eugenol methyl ether (1.61 per cent), S224 â asarone (1.17 per cent), Ã âasarone (92.68 per cent) and S226 âasarone (2.27 per cent), besides four unidentified sesquiterpene alcohols. The dried rhizome from Almora, Pithiragarh and Jogeshwar of Kumaun hills yielded 1.0 â 1.5 per cent of essential oil. GLC analysis of the essential oil obtained from the rhizome growing in three areas of lower hills of Uttar Pradesh ( now Uttaranchal) viz., Pithoragarh, Almora and Chamoli revealed the presence of asarone (76.29 per cent, 88.64 per cent and 78.44 per cent ), methyleugenol (0.69 per cent, 0.63 per cent and 1.19 per cent) and eugenyl acetate (2.29 per cent, 1.98 per cent and 2.27 per cent), respectively in the three oils. The yield and chemical constituents of the oil obtained from plants grown on normal soils. However, the concentration of asarone oil was slightly less in oil obtained from alkaline soils (Chowdhury et al., 1997). The oil obtained from the rhizome of the plant from Sikkim in a yield of 7-8 per cent contained 85 per cent of Ã âasarone. Other constituents identified in the rhizome were a new cylclobutanolignan acoradin, 2,4,5 â trimethoxybenzaldehyde, 2,5 â dimethoxybenzoquinone, galangin (5,7 â dihydroxyflavanol ) along with sitosterol; a new natural product acoramone along with other phenyl propane derivatives viz,. isoeugenol methyl ether, S226 âasarone, Ã â asarone , S224 âasarone and asarylaldehyde. Further , two new phenyl indanes viz., Z-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl ) indane (Saxena, 1986) and two new triterpenoid saponins 1 Ã, 2 S224, 3Ã, 19S224-tetrahydroxyurs -12-en-28-oic acid -28-O-{Ã -D-glucopyranosyl (1-->2)} Ã -D-galactopyranoside and 3 Ã, 22 S224, 24, 29 â tetrahydroxyolean â 12 âen -3-O-{ Ã -D-arabinosyl (1-->3)}- Ã -D- arabinopyranoside were characterized in the ethanolic extract of the rhizome. The petroleum ether and benzene fractions of the rhizome were reported to yield thymol, cumin and phellandrene while the chloroform fraction yielded a triterpene alcohol and a triterpene acid.

The effect was maximal in prooestrus and oestrus. The response was not appreciable in progesterone dominated uterus. Vasicine in 10 mg/kg i.p. dose in oestradiol-primed (50Âµg/kg i.m., 48h previously) guinea pigs showed an abortifacient effect in 90Â±10 per cent of animals during mid and late pregnancy. The abortifacient effect of vasicine like its uterotonic effect was more marked under the priming influence of oestrogens which are known to enhance the synthesis of PGs. Synthesized vasicine and vasicinone derivatives in in vitro studies were found to have oxytocic activity at the dose above 1Âµg/ml while none of them were found to show any bronchodilatory activity up to a dose of 3Âµg/ml. The aqueous solution of the leaves at the dose of 175 mg/kg bw revealed 100 per cent abortifacient activity when administered daily to Charles Foster strain of albino rats from 5-10 of post mating period. The petroleum ether extract of the leaves 50 mg/kg bw and i.v was given after atropinization in rabbits. The expectorant action of the petroleum ether extract was compared with that of ammonium chloride and eucalyptol. Of the three, only the petroleum ether extract showed any stimulation of respiratory tract fluid (RTF). The comparative increase in the production of RTF by two standard respiratory stimulants and âvasakaâ was found to be ammonium chloride (0.4g/kg bw) 47 per cent; eucalyptol (0.184 g/kg bw) 36 per cent and the petroleum ether extract 78.5 per cent, respectively. Vasicinone isolated from the leaves had a bronchodilator action on the normal lungs and powerful bronchodilator action against the histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigâs lungs and tracheal chain, but its action was weaker than that of adrenaline.l-Vasicinone was, however, stronger in action than the dl-form. Vasicinone was found to have a potent bronchodilatory activity in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Vasicine showed bronchodilatory activity in both vivo and in vitro experimental studies, its activity being comparable to theophylline. The antitussive activity of the plant was evaluated in anaesthetized guinea pigs and rabbits and unanaesthetized guinea pigs. When administered intravenously, the extract was 1/20-1/40 as active as codeine on mechanically and electrically-induced coughing in rabbits and guinea pigs. On oral administration to guinea pigs, the antitussive activity of the extract was similar to codeine against coughing induced by irritant aerosols. The non-nitrogenous principle obtained from the leaves as a suspension administered orally (25mg/kg) to fasting male rabbits lowered the blood sugar of rabbits for a short period of two hours. The average fall over a period of four hour was 7.5 per cent which was far less than the fall due to similar dosage of tolbutamide. Repeated oral (2.5-3.0 mg/kg for 30d) and intramuscular administration (10-30 mg/kg for 15d) of vasicine hydrochloride resulted in a dose related increase in platelet count in normal rats, mice, rabbits and dogs while a single dose treatment had no response. This increase in platelets was also associated with significant hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. No effects were observed on haemoglobin level and RBC or WBC counts and morphology. Bleeding and clotting times were not significantly altered nor was there any evidence of in vivo haemolysis. The alcoholic extract of the leaves did not show antitumour activity against various transplantable tumours. The activity of the leaves (alcoholic and chloroform extracts in the form of ointment) was studied for its wound healing effects in twelve, 12-18 months old buffalo calves. A significant increase (p>0.05) in rate of healing, breaking strength, tensile strength, energy absorption and extensibility was observed up to 30d. Collagen, elastin, hydroxyproline, hexosamine and zinc in biopsy specimens significantly increased from 3rd to 30th day. Vasicinol, an alkaloid extracted from the root of the plant produced transient hypotension in cats, contraction of isolated guinea pig intestine and depression of isolated guinea pig heart, all of which could be blocked by atropine which indicated its cholinergic nature, Vasakin, the non-nitrogenous principle obtained from the leaves, had a blocking effect on the exogenous acetylcholine and adrenaline and had a strong anesthetic activity. It inhibited salivary secretion induced by pilocarpine. It had no toxic effects at a dose up to 1g/kg and did not affect behaviour or motor activity in experimental animals. Detailed pharmacological studies were carried out with the alcoholic extract of the leaves. The extract produced fall in blood sugars levels in rats. It had no significant diuretic activity in rats. It enhanced the depth and rate of respiration in dogs and a dose dependent fall in carotid blood pressure. It produced a dose dependent myocardial depression in frog without affect in rectus muscle. It produced considerable relaxation of the isolated guinea pig tracheal chain. The extract had no analgesic or anticonvulsant activity in rats. The extract was not lethal up to the dose of 100 mg/kg i.p and up to 4g/kg p.o. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant (excluding root) in a preliminary biological screening showed antiinflammatory activity in rat. The alcoholic extracts of the leaves and root showed antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Escherichia coli.I11 The water extract of the leaves also showed activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus.I11 The oil obtained from the leaves, flowers and root possessed significant activity against tubercle bacilli. The active substance from the leaves inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis BB1119-4B11 (human) at a concentration of 2Âµg/ml; that of 5Âµg/ml; while the growth of BB1119-1B11 (avian) strain was inhibited completely at concentration of 5Âµg/ml. The antitubercular activity of the active principle from the leaves was half of streptomycin. The 80 per cent ethanolic extract of the leaves using the agar dilution method revealed antibacterial activity against three strains of I11Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilisI11 and I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. The extract of the leaves showed 10-20 mm zone of inhibition against I11Staphylococcus citriI11 and different strains of I11Escherichia coliI11 in in-vitro studies. The aqueous extract of the leaves inhibited the spore germination of the pathogenic fungi I11Curvularia lunata, Cylindrocarpon lichenicola, Fusarium solaniI11 and I11Myrothecium leucotrichum.I11 The leaves also inhibited the mycelial inhibition of I11Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytesI11 and I11Microsporum gypseum.I11 The extract of the plant inhibited the mycelial inhibition of keratinophillic fungi I11Microsporum gypseum, Chrysosporium tropicumI11 and I11Trichophyton terrestre.I11 The crude extract of the leaf, the bark and the plant showed 20-39.9 per cent inhibition of potato virus X and 85 per cent inhibition against bean common mosaic virus. The leaves (oil) as well as the alkaloids, vasicine and vasicinone were screened for anthelmintic activity against I11Ascaris lumbricoidesI11 neuromuscular preparations. The oil caused slight inhibition of the spontaneous movements, whereas the alkaloids, vasicine and vasicinone showed no effects. The powder of the leaves (1:100) was a non-poisonous indigenous insecticide and recommended for controlling the inspect pests of stored oil seeds. Different alkaloids from the plant were responsible for antifertility and antifeedant activity against insects. C11Clinical StudiesC11 Vasicine showed uterotonic activity on human myometrium strips which was in some cases more marked than that of two known oxytocics pitocin and methergin. On myometrial strips for non-pregnant uteri, pregnant uteri during first and second trimester of pregnancy and from full term pregnant uteri, vasicine either initiated rhythmic movements in the quiescent tissue or increased the tone or the amplitude of contractions, or both. The response of the uterus to drugs depended on its hormonal status. In an uncontrolled clinical trial 60 ml of a syrup (30 g of crude drug) was given daily in four divide doses for six weeks in 20 patients of âamlapittaâ. Clinical improvement along with reduction in gastric acidity was observed in 85 per cent of the patients. The syrup also decreased gastric acid secretion in albino rats. View Reference", "pharmacology_reference": "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/view_ref.ajax.php?receive=11&flag=1", "chemical_composition": "The leaves have been found to be a rich source of alkaloids of which vasicine and vasicinone are bioactive. A number of non- nitrogenous compounds have also been isolated. The chemical investigation of the leaves was taken ups as early as 1888 by Hooper who separated the volatile and non âvolatile fractions by steam distillation of the leaves of the plant. The non âvolatile fraction showed positive tests for alkaloids and behaved as an organic acid which was named as adhatodic acid. Later isolated a solid from the leaves of the plant named as vasicine which was basic in nature. It was found to possess a slight but potent bronchodilator activity. A new quaternary ammonium based from the leaves called vasicine which was basic in nature. It was found to be a betaine. Vasicine was shown to contain a 1:3 benzodiazine nucleus. Ghose et al., (1932) later revised the structure from different places which varied from 0.54-1.10 per cent. Besides this, other parameters were also determined. Another bronchodilator alkaloid vasicinone was later isolated from the leaves. It was identified as the autooxidation product of vasicine (Amin and Mehta, 1959. An analysis of the infected leaves of the plant by fungus I11ColletorichumI11 gloeoesporioides showed that vasicinone was lost in the leaves due to the infection, while the other constituents remained unaffected. Further, a non-nitrogenous neutral principle, vasakin; (+) âvasicinone; two new pyrroloquinazoline alkaloids, desmethoxyaniflorine and 7- mehtoxyvasicinone were identified from the ethanolic extract from the leaves. The leaves obtained from different markets in India gave very poor alkaloid yield ranging from 0.28 to 0.51 per cent which was far less than the average yield (1.474 per cent w/w) of alkaloids from the leaves of big leaf variety (BLV) of the plant. The order plant (9-10 year old) of BLV showed uniformly high concentration of alkaloids with much less variation. Thus, the BLV could be utilized as suitable germplasms for cultivation of this plant (Rajani and Paundarikaskshudu, 1996). Effects of a seasonal variation on the alkaloidal contents were studied in the leaves, The maximum alkaloidal content (2 per cent) was found to be in the months of August â October of which vasicine was about 95 per cent, deoxyvasicine (3 per cent) and traces of vasicinone. The total alkaloidal content decreased after October and reached a minimum level in March, when the total percentage was about .04 per cent to 0.6 per cent. The percentage vasicine in the total alkaloidal content decreased to 45 per cent after October while that of vasicinone reached a maximum in August â September when the plant was about to flower. During I11NI11- oxides and glycosides became significant (Pandita et al., 1983). Foliar spray of gibberellic acid at a concentration of 20 mg/l increased the total alkaloidal yield of leaves, root and stem by 85 per cent, 42 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively (Pundarikakshudu et al., 1986). The total alkaloids and vasicine contents were found to occur in higher amounts in the leaves from Varanasi than reported from the plant growing elsewhere in India. The percentage of total alkaloids and vasicine was higher in August (2.20 and 2.09, respectively) and low in February (0.70 and 0.35, respectively) whereas the percentage of minor alkaloids like vasicinol, vasicinone, deoxyvasicinone and deoxyvasicine was maximum in April (0.65) and minimum from June to September (0.0.9-0.11). Foliar spray of chloramphenicol at a concentration of 50 mg/l brought a 50 per cent increase in total alkaloids (vasicine) of the leaves of younger plants (8-12wk old). In older plants, treatment with 100 and 200 mg/l of chloramphenicol exerted a positive on alkaloid formation (Rajani and Bhavsar, 1993). A method to extract, isolate and purify the alkaloids vasicine and vasicinone from the plant. Which could give higher yields and reproducible results was designed based on chromatography and spectrophotometry techniques. A method to estimate vasicine in the leaves was developed. Using this technique, vasicine was estimated in two polyherbal drug formulations âshereeshadi kashayaâ and âyastyadivatiâ as well as the leaves and stem of the plant. In another study, a rapid and accurate method using HPLC was developed for detection, monitoring and quantification of vasicine in the plant as well as herbal preparations containing the plant. The method was reported to be precise (Narayana et al., 1995). The compatability of vasicinone hydrochloride with various excipients was investigated as prerequisite to its formulation. No incompatibility was detected with the excipients like acacia, lactose, starch, gelatin and also with theobroma oil, a common suppository base. The drug showed slow degradation under humid conditions which increased with rise in temperature (Bhalla, 1981a). Useful leads for formulation of drug in oral and parenteral dosage forms were provided (Bhalla, 1982a, b). Preformulation stability studies were also carried out to reveal that vasicine stearate was found to be most stable at pH 3.8 (Gupta et al., 1984, 1985a, b). Synthesis of analogues of vasicine, vasicinone and deoxyvasicinone were reported. The structure of vasicinol isolated from the root was established as 6-hydroxypeganine. The mass fragmentation of the alkaloids vasicine, vasicinol as well as its methyl ether was also studied (Bhatnagar and Popli, 1966). The other alkaloids isolated were 9- acetamido-3,4-dihyropyrido-(3,4-b)-indole, I11OI11-ethyl- S224 âD-galactoside, 1,2,3,9- tetrahydropyrrolo (2,1-b) quinazolin-9 (1H)-one, sitosterol Ã-D-glucoside, D-galactose and deoxyvasicinone (Jain et al., 1980); vasicol (1,2,3,4,9,11-hexahydropyrrolo(2,1-b) quinazolin-3, 11-diol), vasicinone, adhatonine and vasicinolone (Dhar et al., 1981). Vasicinolone was reported as the oxidative product of vasicinol (Jain and Sharma, 1982). The total and reducing sugars present in the root and the bark were also estimated. The different parts of the plant viz., leaves, root and seeds comprised 0.22, 0.14 and 0.25 per cent, respectively, of alkaloids. The root showed the presence of saponins, while the leaves had alkaloids and glycosides. The stem was devoid of all the three. Presence of steroids/terpenoids, alkaloids and tannins, and absence of flavonoids, phenolics and saponins were reported. In another study, the leaves of the plant were reported to contain alkaloids and steroids while flavonoids, glycosides, saponins and terpenoids were reported as sugars and reducing sugars. The leaves had good amounts of raffinose and glucose, while the root had xylose. Besides sugars, vitamin B and C were found in the leaves and root, while the bark contained only vitamin C. The chemical constituents of the plant have been reviewed (Bhat et al., 1978; Suresh Kumar et al., 1981; Jain et al., 1984), The flavonoids in the leaves were identified as kaempferol, quercetin, vitexin and isovitexin while the phenolic acids were I11pI11-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid andcoumaric acid. The leaves were found to contain free vitamin C and carotene. Both leaves and flowers contained the flavone, luteolin. The mineral elements of the leaves were identified as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and iron. The ethanolic extract of the aerial parts yielded two aliphatic hydroxyketones identified as 37-hydroxyhexatetracont -1-en-15-one and 37-hydroxyhentetracontan -19-one, while the petroleum ether extract yielded an aliphatic alcohol characterized as 29-methyltriacontan -l-0l. The stalk, which is non-woody, was found to contain the Klason and Willslatter lignins composed of guaiacyl-, syringyl- and p-hydroxyphenyl propane building units similar to the hardwood lignins. The petroleum ether extract of the flowers contained a number of non-nitrogenous compounds viz., triatricontane, Ã-sitosterol, S224 -amyrin and Ã âsitosterol âD- glucoside; the ether extract yielded kaempferol and quercetin; the ethyl acetate and I11NI11-butanol extracts afforded kaempferol-3- Ã-D-glucoside and kaempferol -3-sophoroside. The young inflorescence yielded (Â±) vasicinone (Choudhury, 1979). Flowers in addition yielded a fat containing traces of tridecanoic and pentadecanoic acids and a new glucoside identified as 2â, 4-dihroxychalcone 4-glucoside. The fixed oil obtained from the seeds contained arachidic (3.1 per cent), behenic (11.2 per cent), lignoceric (10.7 per cent), cerotic (5.0 per cent), oleic (49.9 per cent) and linoleic (12.3 per cent) acids. The unsaponifiable matter yielded Ã-sitosterol. The fatty acid composition (wt per cent) of the seed and flower fats, as determined by gas chromatography was lauric (nil, 1.121), myristic (nil, 2.37), palmitic (4.25, 27.13), heptadecanoic (nil, 2.50), oleic (49.28, 16.58), linoleic (21.53, 13.13), linolenic (1.34, 5.53), arachidic (10.59, 8.56, nil) acids respectively. The only alkaloids found in the defatted seeds and flowers were vasicine, vasicinone and vasicinol (Kapoor et al., 1981).", "uses": [{"disease": "Asthma", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Body ache", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Breathing trouble", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Bronchitis", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Chest pain", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Cold", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Cough", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Fever", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Foot cracks", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Haemorrhage", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Hair growth", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Heel pain", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Increase immunity", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Paralysis", "part_used": "Root"}, {"disease": "Rheumatism", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Scorpion sting", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Snake bite", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Wounds", "part_used": "Leaves"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/14/1/14.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/14/2/14.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Adhatoda zeylanica</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Adhatoda zeylanica </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Malabar nut tree (English) ,Adalsa (Hindi) ,Adarsa (Hindi) ,Adulasa (Hindi) ,Arusa (Hindi) ,Bansa (Hindi) ,Bashing (Hindi) ,Rus (Hindi) ,Rusa (Hindi) ,Vasaka (Hindi) ,Adarsahah (Sanskrit) ,Amalaka (Sanskrit) ,Arushaka (Sanskrit) ,Atarusah (Sanskrit) ,Atarusha (Sanskrit) ,Atarushaka (Sanskrit) ,Bashika (Sanskrit) ,Bhishagmata (Sanskrit) ,Bhishakmata (Sanskrit) ,Kanthiravi (Sanskrit) ,Kanthiravi (Sanskrit) ,Khasanotpatana (Sanskrit) ,Matrisinhi (Sanskrit) ,Mrigendrani (Sanskrit) ,Mrigendrani (Sanskrit) ,Nasa (Sanskrit) ,Panchamukhi (Sanskrit) ,Raktappittaghni (Sanskrit) ,Raktavasa (Sanskrit) ,Ramrupaka (Sanskrit) ,Rasadani (Sanskrit) ,Simhamukhi (Sanskrit) ,Simhasya (Sanskrit) ,Simhavadana (Sanskrit) ,Simhi (Sanskrit) ,Vaasaka (Sanskrit) ,Vajidantaka (Sanskrit) ,Vasa (Sanskrit) ,Aadusoge (Kannada) ,Addalasa (Kannada) ,Addasara (Kannada) ,Adsale (Kannada) ,Adumuttada (Kannada) ,Adusoge soppu (Kannada) ,Aduthoda (Kannada) ,Alusoge (Kannada) ,Atarusha (Kannada) ,Atusoge (Kannada) ,Edumuttanditappu (Kannada) ,Yedum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>Medic.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Family : </b>Acanthaceae</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Basic Description of Plant : </b>A tall shrub, 1-3 m high with many long opposite ascending branches; stem with yellowish bark, terete, glabrous.

The aqueous extract of the leaves and the alcoholic extract of the fruits at a dose of 500 mg/kg fed orally to normal as well as diabetic rabbits significantly lowered the fasting glucose level (p<0.001) in normal rabbits, while in diabetic rabbits the reduction was insignificant (p>0.05). The extract of the fresh tender leaves in water or milk or juice of I11Benincasa ceriferaI11 or âkashayamâ at a dose of 8 ml/kg administered orally for 3 months showed hypoglycaemic action both normal as well as streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rabbits. The antidiabetic effect of alkaloidal extract of the leaves was studied in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. The aqueous extract of the leaves revealed both hypoglycaemic and antihyperglycaemic effects in normal and alloxanized rabbits. The crude leaf extract administered orally to streptozotocin-diabetic rats at a dose of 1 g/kg bw at 24 interval for a period of 2 wk was found to be as effective as insulin in restoring blood glucose and body weight to normal levels. The organic (250 mg dried ethanolic extract per kg bw) and the inorganic parts (90 mg pure ash.kg bw) of the leaves revealed hypoglycaemic activity in a single dose effect on the oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) in fasting albino rats. Marmin, a coumarin isolated from ethanolic extract of the roots showed antiinflammatory effect (62.5 per cent) in carrageenin-induced inflammation in rats at a dose of 1g/kg p.o. In another study, the aqueous extract of the root (5 mg/100g bw i.p. once daily) revealed significant acute as well as chronic antiinflammatory activity in carrageenin-induced rat paw oedema (p>0.01) as evidenced by decrease in granuloma weight. The ethanolic extracts of the leaves (25 and 50 mg/kg bw) when administered orally for 30d in albino rats showed a significant decrease in the weight of the testes (p<0.01 and p<0.001 for the two doses), respectively and the accessory sex organs, reduced sperm count, decreased sperm mortality and both protein and RNA contents of the testes in a dose dependent manner indicating antispermatogenic activity of the plant. The aqueous extract of the leaves revealed cardiac stimulant, smooth muscle relaxant and uterine stimulant properties while the alcoholic extract showed cardiac depressant, smooth muscle relaxant and uterine relaxant properties. âDashmula kvathaâ, an Ayurvedic formulation consisting if A. marmelos besides nine other constituents viz., I11Premna integrifolia, Oroxylum indicum, Stereospermum suaveolens, Gmelina arborea, Desmodium gangeticum, Uraria picta, Solanum indicum, S. xanthocarpumI11 and I11Tribulus terrestrisI11 produced aspirin like analgesic effect in rats. This was supported by a significant antipyretic effect and mild antiinflammatory effect in rats against carrageenin-induced oedema. Further, the âkvathaâ produced CNS depressant effect. In a preliminary survey of antibacterial substances, the alcoholic and aqueous extract of the leaves showed in vitro antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Escherichia coliI11, the alcoholic extract of the root and the aqueous extract of the fruits were found to be active against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 only. The essential oil exhibited antibacterial activity against I11Pseudomonas solanacearumI11 and I11Xanthomonas vesicatoriaI11. The oil obtained from the leaves revealed 20 and 24 per cent antibacterial activity against I11Aeromonas spI11. and I11Escherichia coli,I11 respectively. The aqueous extract of the leaves showed in vitro fungicidal action against I11Pestalotiopsis mangiferaeI11 causing leaf spot of I11Mangifera indicaI11. The methanol extract of the leaves inhibited the mycelial growth and sclerotium formation of the plant fungi I11Sclerotium rolfsiiI11 at five different concentrations. The leaf extract, however, inhibited the growth of I11Colletotrichum falcatumI11 (68.9 per cent), Rhizoctonia solani (92.4 per cent) and Fusarium oxysporum sp. lentis (90.2 per cent). The essential oil obtained from the leaves exhibited significant antifungal activity against I11Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton rubrum, Histoplasma capsulatum,I11 and I11Microsporum cookeiI11. The oil was less active against I11Nocardia brasiliensis, Phialaphora verrucosaI11 and I11Candida albicansI11 while exhibited no activity against I11Epidermophyton floccosum.I11 The essential oil obtained from the leaves inhibited ringworm fungi I11Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum audouinii, M. gypseumI11 and I11Epidermophyton floccosum.I11 The oil obtained from the leaves also inhibited the spore germination of eight plant fungi I11Alternaria alternata, A. brassicae, A. carthami, Colletotrichum capsici, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udumI11 and I11Ustilago cynodontisI11 in a concentration of 500 ppm. The unsaponifiable matter of the seed exhibited considerable in vitro antimicrobial against various bacteria viz., I11Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salm paratyphi, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Vibrio cholerae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 and I11Neisseria gonorrhoeaeI11 and various fungi viz., I11Trichophyton rubrum, T. terrestre Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, Penicillium italicumI11 and I11P. expansumI11 at different dilutions. The unsaponifiable matter was found to be more active than pure seed oil sample against all the test organisms. The ethyl acetate extract of the plant exhibited antibacterial activity against I11Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas putidaI11 and I11Bacillus anthracisI11 and antifungal activity against I11Curvularia lunata, Aspergillus nigerI11 and I11Rhizopus nodulans.I11 The ethanolic extract of the root showed antimicrobial activity against I11Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatusI11 and I11Trichophyton mentagrophytesI11 (Pitre and Srivastava, 1987). The 80 per cent ethanolic extract of the root revealed antibacterial activity against strains of I11Escherichia coliI11 and I11Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 at a concentration of 12.5 mg/ml and against I11Bacillus subtilisI11 and I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 at a concentration of 6.25 mg/ml using the agar dilution method, The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the fruits showed antiviral activity against Ranikhet disease virus. The extract of the bark showed antiviral activity against potato virus X (Singh and Singh, 1972) while that of the fruits exhibited interferon-like antiviral activity against Ranikhet disease virus but not against vaccinia virus. The essential oil obtained from the leaves revealed antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus. The unsaponifiable matter of the seed exhibited anthelmintic activity against tapeworms and earthworms. C11Clinical Studies C11 If an uncontrolled clinical trial, the leaves of the plant were macerated and given orally followed by powdered black pepper on empty stomach to 8 patients with diabetes mellitus for 15d. A significant diminution in the blood cholesterol levels with slight lowering of blood glucose levels in all patients were reported. All the patients also had a sense of well being during treatment. The efficacy of the fruits for the treatment of dysentery was tested in 25 patients. The patients were given powdered unripe fruits (5g thrice daily for 21d). Out of 25 patients, 52 per cent were completely cured, 44 per cent improved and 4 per cent remained unaffected. Its use in dysentery might be due to the presence of large amount of tannins. Fruit pulp powder was found effective on intestinal parasites particularly on ankylostoma. The drug controlled loose and irregular motion and pain in abdomen. The alkaloid, aegeline present in leaves was found efficacious in asthma.

The fruit pulp contained alloimperatorin, Ã-sitosterol and imperatorin âchemically S226, S226 -dimethylallyloxyfurocoumarin (Saha and Chatterjee, 1957). Further, a new coumarin marmelide along with xanthotaxol, Ã-sitosterol â Ã-D-glucoside, scoparone, scopoletin, umbelliferone, marmesin and skimmin (Sharma et al., 1980) The leaves yielded an alkaloid, rutacin and sterol, aegeline (Chatterjee and Bose, 1952). Aegelin, in later studies, was shown to be a neutral alkaloid and not a sterol and was characterized as (Â±)-trans-N-[Ã-hydroxy- Ã-(p-methoxyphenyl)] ethylcinnamide. Its stereochemistry and synthesis were studied in detail (Chakarvarti and Dasgupta, 1955,1956a,b). Aegelenine, another minor alkaloid was isolated from the leaves. On chemical studies aegelenine was found to be identical with halfordinol, the basic constituent of I11Halfordia scleroxylaI11. The leaves were also found to contain S226 -sitosterol (Chakarvarti and Dasgupta, 1956c). The leaves were also found to contain Ã-sitosterol- Ã-D-glucoside, marmesinin and rutin (Sharma et al., 1980); lupeol and sitosterol; condensed tannins, phlobatannis, flavon-3-ols, leucoanthocyanins, anthocyanins and flavonoids glycosides. Very young leaves contained highest concentration of tannins (8.1 per cent) where as fully ripe fruit contained only 1.5 per cent (Bajaj et al., 1975). The average tannin content in the leaves was found to be 1.21 g/100g dry matter basis. The constituents, especially alkaloids and coumarins of the bark, varied considerably with the maturity of the tree. Whereas the young bark contained umbelliferone, the old or mature bark contained in addition to umbelliferone, a different coumarin and other constituents like S226 -fagarine, marmesin, aurepten(e) and lupeol. Marmin, a new coumarin isolated from the trunk bark was initially suggested as 7-(3,7-dihdroxy-3,7-dimethyloctyloxy) coumarin, subsequently its chemical structure was revised to 7-(6â,7â-dihydroxy-3â,7â-dimethyloct-2-enyloxy) coumarin. It was also reported that with maturity of the bark the yields of Marmin and skimmianine decreased and contents of marmesin, S226-fagarine and essential oil increased. The ether extract of the immature bark contained umbelliferone, an alkaloid, skimmianine (4,7,8-trimethoxyfuroquinoline), Marmin and S226-sitosterol. The stem bark contained two new compounds marmesin-1ââ-S224-L-rhamnopyranoside and 1,5-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-2-methylanthraquinone together with lupeol and Ã-sitosterol. It also contained 5.52 per cent of tannins and 6.36 per cent of non tannins. The root was reported to contain lupeol, skimmianine and three benzo-(a)-pyrone derivatives viz., auraptene, marmin and umbelliferone. This was the first report of occurrence auraptene in this plant. In another study, different extracts of the root afforded the coumarins and the alkaloids viz., psoralen, xanthotoxin, 6,7-umbelliferone,marmesin, marmin and skimmianine. The root bark contained the coumarin, decursinol and an alkaloid haplopine while both root and the stem bark contained aegelinol (3â-epimer of decursinol). The leaves yielded 0.6 per cent of an essential oil which contained (+)-S224-phellandrene (56 per cent) as the major constituent besides cineol, citronellal, citral, I11pI11-cymene (17 per cent) and cumin aldehyde (5 per cent). The essential oils from the twigs and the fruits of the plant contained, (+)-S224-phellandrene; the oil from twigs also contained cineol while it was found absent in fruit oil (Baslas and Deshpande, 1949). The essential oil from the leaves growing in the Tarai region of Nainital contained S224-phellandrene (20 per cent), I11pI11-cymene (11.5 per cent), cineol (2.5 per cent), (+)-limonene (10 per cent), ethyl I11nI11-amyl ketone (5.25 per cent), methyl âI11nI11-heptyl ketone (3.75 per cent), citronella (10 per cent), linalool (3.75 per cent), citral (5 per cent), eugenol (6 per cent), methyl eugenol (trace), caryophyllene (7.5 per cent) and cuminyl alcohol (3.5 per cent). The physico-chemical constants were also determined (Bhandari and Gupta, 1972). The oil obtained from the leaves from Lucknow was found to contain myrcene (54.03 per cent, Ã-caryophyllene (6.17 per cent), S224-humulene (4.97 per cent), S226-terpinene (4.40 per cent), limonene (4.20 per cent), sabinene (3.40 per cent), myrtenol (2.67 per cent), (Z) - Ã-ocimene (2.30 per cent) besides other minor constituents S224-and Ã-pinene, I11pI11-menth-4(8)-en-l-ol-,8-triene, linalool, piperitone, terpinen-4-ol, piperitol, trans-carveol, p-menth-4(8)-en-l-ol, I11cisI11-carveol, sabinol, myrtenyl acetate, I11pI11-menth-l-en-3Ã, 5Ã-diol, S224-elemene, ar-curcumene and caryophyllene oxide. ?-Phellandrene reported earlier could not be detected even as a trace constituent. New naturally occurring alkaloids characterized as O-methylhalfordinol were isolated from the ripe fruits. Alloimperatorin methyl ether, hitherto unknown in the genus I11AegleI11 and I11OI11 âisopentenylhalfordinol earlier detected in the leaves were also obtained from the fruits. The unripe fruits contained marmeline identified as N-2-hydroxy-2[4-(3â, 3â dimethylallyloxy) phenyl] ethylcinnamide along with aegeline, imperatorin, alloimperatorin and xanthotaxol. Further eight new alkaloids, viz.,O-(3â,3â-dimethylallyl)- halfordinol; N-2-ethoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethylcinnamamide; N-2-methoxy-2-[4-(3â,3â-dimethylallyloxyl)phenyl]ethylcinnamamide; N-2-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl) ethylcinnamide; N-2-[4-3â,3â-dimethylallyloxy) phenyl] ethylcinnamide; N-2 hydroxy-2-(4-(3â,3â-dimethylallyloxy)phenyl] ethylcinnamide. N-4-methoxystylcinnamide and N-2-hydroxy -2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethylcinnamide were isolated from the leaves. Their structure were also confirmed by synthesis (Manandhar et al., 1978; Govindachari and Premila, 1983). The heartwood contained a furoquinoline alkaloid, dictamnine; a dihydrofurocoumarin, marmesin; Ã-sitosterol; 2-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)vinyl acetate, xanthotaxol-8-O- Ã-D-glucopyranoside, lupeol (Jain et al., 1991); two new anthraquinones, 7,8-dimethoxy-1-hydroxy02-methylanthraquinone and 6-hydroxy-1-methoxy-3-methylanthraquinone along with marmin and xanthotaxol.", "uses": [{"disease": "Blood pressure", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Diabetes", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Increase fertility in men", "part_used": "Leaves"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/17/1/17.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/17/2/17.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Aegle marmelos</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Aegle marmelos </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Bael fruit tree (English) ,Bael tree (English) ,Bel Tree (English) ,Beli (English) ,Bengal quince (English) ,Golden apple (English) ,Holy fruit (English) ,Indian Quince (English) ,Stone apple (English) ,Bel (Hindi) ,Bello (Hindi) ,Bili (Hindi) ,Siriphal (Hindi) ,Sirphal (Hindi) ,Adhararuha (Sanskrit) ,Arimedah (Sanskrit) ,Asholam (Sanskrit) ,Atimangaliya (Sanskrit) ,Bhiva (Sanskrit) ,Bilva (Sanskrit) ,Bilwah (Sanskrit) ,Duraruha (Sanskrit) ,Gandhagarbha (Sanskrit) ,Gandhapatraha (Sanskrit) ,Gandhaphalaha (Sanskrit) ,Hrdyagandha (Sanskrit) ,Hridyagandha (Sanskrit) ,Kantakadhyah (Sanskrit) ,Kantaki (Sanskrit) ,Karkata (Sanskrit) ,Karkata (Sanskrit) ,Laxmiphala (Sanskrit) ,Laxmiphalah (Sanskrit) ,Malura (Sanskrit) ,Putimaruta (Sanskrit) ,Putrashreshta (Sanskrit) ,Sadaphala (Sanskrit) ,Sailusha (Sanskrit) ,Salatu (Sanskrit) ,Salya (Sanskrit) ,Samirasaraha (Sanskrit) ,Samirasaraka (Sanskrit) ,Sandilya (Sanskrit) ,Satyakarma (Sanskrit) ,Sitanana (Sanskrit) ,Sivadhruma (Sanskrit) ,Sivadrum (Sanskrit) ,Sriphala (Sans</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>(L.)

The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant in a preliminary biological screening was found to be devoid of antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiviral, hypoglycaemic, anticancer and diuretic activities. The extract also had no effects on isolated guinea pig ileum, respiration, CVS and CNS in experimental animals. The LDB1150B11 of the extract was found to be >1000 mg/kg i.p. in mice. The water soluble portion of the alcoholic extract of the plant potentiated pentobarbitone-induced hypnosis in mice in a dose of 1g/kg. It produced hypotensive response in dog. The extract revealed negative inotropic and chronotropic effects in doses of 10-40 mg on frogâs perfused heart which was not blocked by atropine. The extract had no analgesic and anticonvulsant activity. The essential oil in a concentration of 0.1 ml/ml caused contraction of the isolated frog rectus abdominis within 15 sec after administration. The ethanolic extracts of the root of plant in a dose of 100 and 300 mg/kg significantly reduced the carrageenin-induced hind paw oedema in rats. The extract was devoid of any appreciable activity on CNS in rats. The extract had no acute toxic effect in mice. The essential oil obtained from the plant showed antibacterial activity against I11Vibrio cholerae ogawa, Shigella shigae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium diphtheriaeI11 and I11Salmonella typhi, I11 while it was devoid of any activity against the potato pathogenic bacteria viz., I11Bacillus polymexa, Erwinia carotovora var. atroseptica, E. carotovora var. carotovora, Pseudomonas putida, Ps solanacearumI11 and I11Xanthomonas vesicatoria. I11 The essential oil of the plant showed antifungal activity against I11Helminthosporium turcicum, H. oryzae, Colletotrichum capsici, Pyricularia setariaeI11 and I11Fusarium moniliforme.I11 At a concentration of 2000 ppm, the essential oil exhibited strong antifungal activity against I11Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canisI11 and I11Trichophyton mentagrophytes.I11 The antifungal principle was identified as demethoxyageratochromene. The leaf extract was found to be active against I11Colletotrichum falcatumI11 and I11Rhizoctonia solani.I11 The essential oil of the plant exhibited anthelmintic activity against I11Taenia soliumI11 and I11Pheretima posthuma.I11 The extract of the plant possessed insecticidal activity against I11Musca domesticaI11 (35 per cent) and I11Tribolium castaneumI11 (40 per cent). The methanolic extract of the plant in a concentration of 200-300 ppm was found to suppress the population of the malaria vector I11Anopheles stephensiI11 in higher dosage, while in lower dosage it was found to induce several developmental defects and ultimately decrease the growth index to a considerable extent. The petroleum ether extract of the leaves, flowers and buds diluted in benzene and mixed with green gram seeds at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 parts per 100 parts of the seeds (w/w) proved very repulsive, a potent oviposition inhibitor and a safe protectant against the infestation of pulse beetle I11Callosobruchus chinensisI11.

The fresh flowers on water distillation gave an oil in 0.2 per cent yield which was found to consist of four major and several trace constituents. These were identified as S226 -cadinene, caryophyllene, demethoxyageratochromene and ageratochromene (Sood, 1973). The oil from the flowers and leaves obtained from Indore showed the presence of S224-pinene, S226-cadinene, Ã-caryophyllene, 7-methoxy-2,2-dimethylageratochromene (60.0 per cent), 6,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethylageratochromene and eugenol (Sharma et al., 1980a). The hexane extract of the plant yielded a coumarin. The ethanolic extract of the plant was found to be devoid of tannins. The shoot contained saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids. The plant on extraction with ethanol, led to the isolation of twelve polyoxygenated flavones three of which were new ones, namely ageconyflavone A (5,6,7-trimethoxy-3â,4â-methylenedioxyflavone), ageconyflavone B(5,6,7,3â-tetramethoxy-4â-hydroxyflavone) and ageconyflavone C 5,6,7,3â,5â-pentamethoxy-4â-hydroxyflavone). The other nine flavonoids were identified as lindereroflavone B; eupalestin; nobiletin; 5â-methoxynobiletin; 5,6,7,5â-tetramethoxy-3â,4â-methylenedixyflavone; sinensetin; 5,6,7,3â,4â,5â-hexamethoxyflavone; 5,6,7,8,3â-pentamethoxy-4âhydroxyflavone and 5,6,7,8,3â,5â-hexamethoxy-4â-hydroxyflavone. Eupalestin was earlier reported to occur in the plant. The essential oil (0.14 per cent) obtained from the leaves and twigs from Imphal contained high amount of precocene I (leaves 23.3 per cent and flowers 25 per cent). The root oil, however, was found to contain precocene II and caryophyllene (Borthakur et al., 1987). The ethanolic extract of the leaves of the plant from South India (Tirupathi) was found to contain stigmast-7-en-3-ol in addition to quercetin, kaempferol, fumaric and caffeic acids (Nair et al., 1977). The petroleum ether extract of the leaves from Nainital (Uttaranchal) on GLC analysis revealed the following composition of sterols: Ã-sitosterol (26.7 per cent), stigmasterol (59.9 per cent), dihydrospinasterol (5.7 per cent), spinasterol (5.2 per cent), dihydrobrassicasterol (2.7 per cent) and brassicasterol (0.3 per cent) (Dubey et al., 1989).

The fresh juice of the leaves (0.2 ml/100 g i.p.) was studied for its antiinflammatory and wound healing in rats. Antiinflammatory activity was studied using carrageenin-induced paw edema method. Wound healing effects were studied on incision (skin breaking strength), excision (per cent wound contraction and epithelisation time) and dead space (granuloma breakings strength and biochemical parameters) wound models. The juice exhibited significant antiinflammatory activity (65 per cent) in acute inflammatory model with no significant effect on chronic inflammation. Influence of the leaf gel on the collagen content and its characteristics in healing dermal wounds was studied. It was observed that the gel increased the collagen content of the granulation tissue as well as its degree of crosslinking as observed by increased aldehyde content and decreased acid solubility. The gel obtained from the leaves administered twice a day either orally or applied topically was found to have a positive influence on the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) components in the matrix of healing dermal wounds in rats. Preliminary screening revealed different extracts of the leaves and other parts of the plant to exhibit antifertility activity in various experimental studies. The aqueous extract of the leaves showed antifertility activity in mice and rats. The leaves revealed very little oxytocic activity in guinea pigs. The juice of the leaves at a dose of 150mg/100 g bw has oestrogenic activity in female albino rats as revealed by its effect on vaginal openings of immature rats, vaginal cornification and weight of uterus. The aqueous extract of the pulp obtained from the leaves at a dose of 200 mg/kg orally showed antiimplantation activity in 40 per cent of albino rats, Contrary to the above findings, the other group of workers did not find the antifertility activity of the leaves in their studies. The alcoholic (90 per cent), aqueous and petroleum ether extracts, the alcoholic extract (50 per cent) and the benzene extract of the leaves at doses of 100 and 150 mg/kg bw administered orally did not show any antiimplantation resorptive activity in albino rats. The aqueous extract of the leaves lowered the total cholesterol by 61.7 per cent, triglyceride by 37.8 per cent, phospholipid by 51.2 per cent and non esterified free fatty acid by 45.5 per cent (p<0.001) in Triton (WR-1339) induced hyperlipidaemia in Presbytis monkeys. In an ethnopharmacological survey for potential antihypertensives from plants, the leaf extract was investigated for its in vitro angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting activity. The water, ethanol and acetone extracts of leaves were found to exhibit 39, 32 and 21 per cent ACE inhibition, respectively. The pretreatment of the leaf extract of the plant at 50 and 100mg/kg doses injected i.p. for 4d before being exposed to radiations revealed radiomodifying effects of the extract on the testes of Swiss albino mice. The extract was non toxic when injected up to 800 mg/kg. In a preliminary study, the dried juice from the fresh leaves was reported to have hypoglycaemic activity in normal albino rabbits and alloxan-diabetic rabbits. The juice extracted from the leaves in a dose of 250 mg/kg i.p. revealed analgesic activity in albino rats. The 50 per cent ethanolic extracts of the plant and leaves in a preliminary biological screening were found to be devoid of antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiviral, hypoglycaemic and anticancer activities and effects on isolated guinea pig ileum and CNS in experimental animals. The alcoholic extract of the stem showed in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (Singh et al., 1973). The water extractive of the plant revealed varying degree of antibacterial activity against I11Bacillus pumilusI11 (+), I11Bac subtilisI11 (+), I11Bac megateriumI11 (+), I11Bac cereusI11 (+), I11Escherichia coliI11 (-), I11Klebsiella pneumoniaeI11 (-), I11Shigella sonneiI11 (-), I11Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 (-) and I11Salmonella typhiI11 (-). The extract showed maximum activity against I11Bacillus megateriumI11 (+). The alcoholic extract of the plant showed some in vitro antibacterial activity against I11Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Proteus vulgaris.I11 The aqueous extract was active only against I11Bacillus subtilisI11 while the hexane extract was devoid of any activity against all the bacteria tested. The leaf extracts of the plant showed high mortality of root knot I11Meloidogyne incognitaI11 and reniform nematode I11Rotylenchulus reniformis.I11 The chemical constitution and the biological activity of the plant have been reviewed by Joshi and associates (1986). C11Clinical StudiesC11 In a study involving 5000 patients of artheromatous heart disease, presented as angina pectoris were studied over a period of 5 years. There was a marked reduction in total serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, total lipids and fasting and post prandial blood sugar in diabetic patients, and also an increase in HDL. The clinical profile of these patients showed reduction in the frequency of anginal attacks and gradually, the drugs like verapamil, nifedipine, Ã-blockers and nitrates taken for hypertension and angina control were tapered but could not be withdrawn completely.

Aloin is of medical importance. Aloe contains as its major and active principles hydroxy anthrone derivatives, mainly of the aloe-emodin-anthrone 10-C-glucoside type. The major constituent is known as barbaloin (aloin) (15-40%) (8, 13). It also contains hydroxy aloin (about 3%). Barbaloin (=aloin) is in fact a mixture of aloin A (10S) [1] and B (10R) [2]. A. ferox also contains aloinoside A [3] and B [4]. Aloin A and B interconvert through the anthranol form as do aloinoside A and B (13). Chemical analyses of the Indian aloes available in the market which belong to different varieties have been carried out and there are conflicting reports regarding their aloin content. According to one study there was no aloin reported but only some resin and small quantities of anthraquinone derivatives like aloe-emodin were present. In another study, samples of Indian aloes obtained from the hilly tracts of Kerala contained 27-30 per cent of aloin which were comparable to Barbados Aloe (Mukerji and Karkun, 1950). The aloin content in the leaves of different species of Aloe revealed highest percentage (21.78 per cent) in A. vera and lowest (8.59 per cent) in A. ciliaris. The percentage of reducing sugars, non reducing sugars, gums and resins in aloin obtained from different species of Aloe were also estimated. The leaves were also found to contain malic, citric and tartaric acids along with sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The barbaloin content of Indian aloes, estimated according to the method of Fairbairn and Simic, was found to be very low (4.24 per cent) as compared to other varieties. The aloeitic juice drained from the transversely cut base of the leaves contained barbaloin in the range from 2.52-13.39 per cent over a period of eight months. The market samples of aloes had barbaloin ranging from 0 to 5.7 per cent (Bhavsar et al., 1991). The free vitamin C and carotene contents of the leaves were found to be 20.0 mg/100g and 600.0 Âµg/100g, respectively. The plant was reported to contain glycosides and gum-resin mucilage (Yoganarasimhan et al., 1985). A polysaccharide (SB113B11) was isolated from the leaf juice. The method of isolation of this polysaccharide, qualitative detection of the constituent sugars and their quantitative estimation were described (Venkata Rao et al., 1976). The mucilaginous jelly isolated from the fleshy leaves of the plant collected from Kolkata was shown to be a mixture of polysaccharides (PS-A) containing mainly pectic acid along with D-galactan a glucomannan and a arabinan, The glucomannan was neither linear nor acetylated having much lower molecular weight. Controlled hydrolysis of the purified pectic acid furnished an acidic oligosaccharide containing Gal A and Gal components in the molar ratio of 5:1.

The interesting activities were anthelmintic, antifilarial and larvicidal. Only the anthelmintic activity has been clinically tested and proved. The antiinflammatory activity of (-) epicatechin isolated from the seed coat was studied in comparison with phenylbutazone. It was found to significantly reduce the rat paw oedema induced by carrageenin. Cardol, the phenolic compound isolated from cashewnut shell, showed pronounced antifilarial activity when given orally. The mutagenicity of the petroleum ether extract of cashewnut shell was tested using Salmonella typhimurium (Ameâs test) strains TA 1535, TA 100 and TA 98. It revealed that CNSL was non mutagenic up to a concentration of 0.003 per cent (0.1 ml DMSO) with and without metabolic activation (S9 mixture). The commercially available oil derived from the shell of cashewnut was evaluated for its potency in promoting the DMBA (7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-initiated cells into papillomas in a murine two â stage skin tumourigenesis is model system. The results revealed a weak tumour promoting effect on cashewnut shell oil as the mean tumour groups, respectively while the corresponding value was 6.6 in the positive control group. Repeated application of cashewnut shell liquid on the skin of mice daily for 11 wk caused necrotic skin lesions with granuloma formation and promoted the occurrence of polyarthritis. No malignant changes or precancerous lesions were observed in biopsied samples. The essential oil of the plant at a dose of 150 and 300 mg/kg was found to be CNS depressant. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the leaves in a preliminary biological screening showed hypoglycaemic activity in rat and anticancer activity against hepatoma 129 in mouse. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the essential oil from the leaves was studied against 4 gram positive and 18 gram negative bacteria using filter paper disc agar diffusion technique. The oil exhibited antibacterial activity against all the organisms but revealed marked activity against I11Pseudomonas mangiferae, Salmonella sp., Bacillus mycoides, Vibrio choleraeI11 and I11Xanthomonas campestris. Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 was found to be susceptible to the oil. The essential oil obtained from the leaves was tested for its antimycotic properties against six dermatophytes viz., I11Keratinomyces ajelloi, Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton equinum, T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrumI11 and I11T. terrestreI11. The oil was found to have moderate activity against all the test organisms in comparison to the control (1000 ppm griseofulvin). The chloroform and the methanol extracts (fractionated into acetone-soluble and insoluble parts) of the leaves revealed antimicrobial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria viz., I11Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniaeI11 as well as the fungi I11Candida albicans.I11 The cashewnut shell oil was used as a mosquito larvicide against the larvae and pupae of I11Armigeres obturansI11, a culcine mosquito. The crushed aqueous extract of the ripe seed shells (03g) showed larvicidal activity against the larvae of I11Culex quinquefasciatusI11 and was found to be over 20 times higher than that of Adhatoda plant which was earlier reported to be an antilarval agent. C11Clinical StudiesC11 In a preliminary clinical trial in the treatment of hook worm and round worm infestations, cashewnut shell oil at various doses was found to cure 7 out of 10 cases of Ascaris infection. In the remaining three cases there was a substantial reduction in egg count. In another study, out of 47 cases of infection by I11Ascaris lumbricoidesI11 30 were cured with a single treatment of 5-6 g of cashew nut shell oil while in 5 more the egg count reduction was 70-80 per cent. Out of 78 cases of hook worm infection 28 were cured and 6 more almost cured by one treatment. Cardol obtained from the shell liquid was studied for its anthelmintic action. 16 out of 23 cases of Ascaris infection, 19 out of 37 cases of hook worm infection and 3 out of 10 cases of Trichuris infection were cured by single treatment of cardol at the dose of 6g in gelatin capsules on empty stomach was given to each patient.

Leucocyanidin was isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble portion of the husk while quinic and caffeic acids were isolated from the non-tannin portion of the husk. The ethanolic extract of the shells of one year old sample of mature cashew nuts yielded kajin, a glycoside, kajidin and gallic acid. In a ten year old sample anacardin was reported in place of kajidin. Kajidin was later identified as 3, 4, 3â, 4â-tetrahydroxdiphenic acid dilactone (ellagic acid).The ethanolic extract of the nut shells yielded a new biflavonoid glycoside, named occidentoside whose structure was established as tetrahydrohinokiflavone-C-glucoside. This was the first biflavonoid to occur with one flavanone and one chalcone unit each and the first C-glycoside in the biflavonoid series. Besides this (-)-salipurposide and Ã-sitosterol were also isolated. The acetone extract of the defatted nut shells yielded a new acylated flavanone glycoside characterized as pruning-6ââ- I11OI11 â I11pI11-coumarate [naringenin-7- I11OI11 -(6ââ- I11OI11 â I11pI11-coumaryl)- Ã-D-glucoside]. The cashewnut liquid free shells fractionated into ether soluble and ether insoluble portions yielded syringic acid and (+)-gallocatechin, respectively. CNSL was reported to be a rich source of naturally occurring phenols. The oil comprised of anacardic acid, cardol, cardanol and 6-methyl cardol besides two unknown minor substances. The chemical characterization of cardol, cardanol, and anacardic acid was studied in detail. Anacardic acid isolated from the solvent extracted CNSL was separated into saturated component and a mono-, di-, and triolefin, which were identified as l-hydroxy-2-carboxy-3-pentadecylbenzene, 1-hydroxy-2-carboxy-3-(8â-pentadecenyl) benzene; 1-hydroxy-2-carboxy-3-(8â, 11ââ-pentadecadienyl) benzene and 1-hydroxy-2-carboxy-3-( 8â, 11â, 14â-pentadecadienyl) benzene, respectively. The chemical aspects of cashewnut shell liquid were reviewed. Dipole moments of both anacardic acid and cardol; surface active characteristics of sodium salts of anacardic acid and NMR spectra of cardanol, 6-methylcardol, cardol and of monoene, diene, and triene components separated from cardanol were reported (Gedam et al., 1972). Analogues of some of the compounds of biological significance such as warfarin, phenolphthalein, salvigenin, salicylanilide, salicylamide and tetrahydroanacardic acid were prepared using the saturated phenolic components of CNSL viz., tetrahydrocardinol, tetrahydrocardol and tetrahydroanacardic acid instead of phenol, resorcinol and salicylic acid used normally for their preparation. The presence of long alkyl chain in these starting materials resulted in analogues which were expected to render the new drugs with fat-solubility and less toxicity. In an attempt to get germicidal compounds, several quaternary nitrogen derivatives were prepared from the monophenolic components viz., cardanol and anacardic acid of CNSL. Quantitative composition of the major phenolic lipids (anacardic acids, cardols and cardanols) of the apple, kernel and shell were determined at various stages of development by high performance liquid chromatography. The results suggested the possibility of a fatty acid type biogenesis of these phenolic lipids. Cardanols and cardols appeared to be genuine metabolites and not artefacts formed the corresponding carboxylic acids during isolation. The fruits were found to be devoid of bioflavonoids. The flowers were reported to yield the polyphenols viz., ethyl gallate, quercetin, hyperoside and I11mI11-digallic acid while the tender leaves showed the presence of Ã-sitosterol, ethyl gallate, hyperoside, methyl gallate, leucocyanidin and leucodelphinidin. The bark had condensed tannins, while no crystalline components were isolated. The leaves were reported to yield myricetin, agathisflavone, robustaflavone, amentoflavone, quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin and two glycosides viz., quercetin-3- I11OI11 ârhamnoside and quercetin-3- I11OI11 âglucoside (Arya et al., 1989). The essential oil obtained from the leaves on thin layer and gas liquid chromatography revealed thirty compounds in varying percentages, the major being car-3-ene- (25.78 per cent), geraniol (6.07 per cent) and carvacrol (5.94 per cent). The seed testa has been reported to be a good source of tannins. In addition, it was reported to contain (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin as the major polyphenols along with proanthocyanidins, leucocyanidin and leucopelargonidin. The ethyl acetate extract of the seed testa contained catechin and (-)-epiafzelechin.", "uses": [{"disease": "Dysentery", "part_used": "Stem/Bark"}, {"disease": "Dysentery", "part_used": "Fruit"}, {"disease": "Maggot infested wounds", "part_used": "Seed"}, {"disease": "Veneral diseases", "part_used": "Root"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/34/1/34.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/34/2/34.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Anacardium occidentale</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Anacardium occidentale </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Acajou (English) ,Cardol (English) ,Cashew apple (English) ,Cashew nut (English) ,Coffin nail (English) ,West indian cashew nut (English) ,Duk (Hindi) ,Kaju (Hindi) ,Kaju ki gutli (Hindi) ,Agnikrita (Sanskrit) ,Agnikritha (Sanskrit) ,Arushkara (Sanskrit) ,Guchhapushpa (Sanskrit) ,Kajutah (Sanskrit) ,Kajutaka (Sanskrit) ,Kajutakah (Sanskrit) ,Parvati (Sanskrit) ,Prithagabija (Sanskrit) ,Shoephahara (Sanskrit) ,Sophahara (Sanskrit) ,Sophara (Sanskrit) ,Srigdhahapitaphala (Sanskrit) ,Srigdhapitaphla (Sanskrit) ,Upapushpika (Sanskrit) ,Venamrah (Sanskrit) ,Vrittapatra (Sanskrit) ,Vrkkabijah (Sanskrit) ,Vrkkaphalah (Sanskrit) ,Vrttarushkarah (Sanskrit) ,Gaerumara (Kannada) ,Gerapoppu (Kannada) ,Geru (Kannada) ,Geru Pappu (Kannada) ,Gerubija (Kannada) ,Godambe (Kannada) ,Godambi Mara (Kannada) ,Govamba (Kannada) ,Gove (Kannada) ,Jidi (Kannada) ,Kempugeru (Kannada) ,Kempukerubija (Kannada) ,Mandiri Pappu (Kannada) ,Thuruka Geru (Kannada) ,Turakageru (Kannada) ,Kaju (Marathi) ,Kajucha bi (Marathi) ,Kapa-Mava (Malayal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>L.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Family : </b>Anacardiaceae</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Basic Description of Plant : </b>Small tree with a short crooked trunk.

The extract was reported to increase biliary flow and liver weight and decreased the duration of action of hexobarbital. The oral administration of the aqueous extract of the leaves (12 mg/kg bw) to mice delayed the hepatic tumourigenic condition induced by hexachlorocyclohexane (BHC). A single dose of andrographolide (5 mg/kg orally) and âkalmeghâ leaf extract (500mg/kg orally) prevented CCIB114B11-induced changes in enzyme activities in serum and liver of rats. Oral administration of a single dose of âkalmeghâ leaf extract (0.5g/kg and 1.0g/kg) or andrographolide (5mg/kg and 10mg/kg) to adult male albino rats produced a dose-related and time-dependent characteristic activation of brush border membrane â bound hydrolases, viz., lactase, maltase and sucrase in three disaccharidases were obtained at 6h of either the leaf extract or the andrographolide administration. The leaves (0.5g/kg administered orally once a day for six days) were evaluated in CCIB114B11-induced liver damage in rabbits. There was a marked clinical recovery from liver damage and significant reduction in AST and ALT enzyme level was reported, The alcoholic extract of the leaves obtained by cold maceration at a dose of 300 mg/kg (1/6 of LDB1150B11) administered orally to albino rats for 8wk showed hepatoprotective activity against CCIB114B11-induced liver damage which was evident by morphological, biochemical and functional parameters. The antihepatotoxic activity of andrographolide (100 mg/kg i.p.) was compared with 861.33 mg/kg i.p. of the methanolic extract (equivalent to 100 mg/kg of andrographolide) and 761.33 mg/kg i.p. of the andrographolide free methanolic extract (equivalent to 861.33mg/kg of the methanolic extract) of the plant, using CCIB114B11-intoxicated rats. Biochemical parameters like serum transaminases â GOT and GPT, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum bilirubin and hepatic triglycerides were estimated to assess the liver function. The overall inhibition of CCIB114B11-induced increase in the five biochemical parameters was found to be 48.6 per cent (andrographolide), 32.0 per cent (methanolic extract) and 15.0 per cent (andrographolide-free methanolic extract). The hepatoprotective effect of andrographolide was studied on acute hepatitis induced in rats by single dose of galactosamine (800 mg/kg i.p.) and paracetamol (3g/kg p.o.). Hepatoprotective activity was monitored by estimating the serum transaminases (GOT and GPT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin in serum, hepatic triglycerides and by histopathological changes in the livers of experimental rats. The results confirmed the in vivo hepatoprotective effect of andrographolide against galactosamine or paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Andrographolide showed a significant dose-dependent (0.75-12 mg/kg p.o. for 7d) protective activity against paracetamol-induced toxicity on ex-vivo preparations of isolated rat hepatocytes. Andrographolide, given by oral route, possessed dose-dependent (3-12mg/kg) activity in rats against galactosamine-induced hepatic damage. The antihepatotoxic effects of the diterpenes andrographolide (I), andrographiside (II), and neoandrographolide (III) isolated from the leaves were investigated for their protective effects on the hepatotoxicity induced in mice by CCI4or tert-butylhydroperoxide (t BHP) intoxication. Administration of an alcoholic extract of the fresh plant (25mg/kg) and two of its constituent diterpenes, andrographolide and neoandrographolide (6 mg/kg/day for two weeks) showed significant antihepatotoxic action in Plasmodium berghei K173-induced hepatic damage in Mastomys natalensis. Apigenin 7, 4-di- I11OI11 âmethyl ether, the flavone isolated from the root was tested for its antigastric ulcer property in various animal models. The animals received a suspension of the compound orally in doses of 5, 10 and 50 mg/kg. The flavone produced a significant dose-dependent antiulcer activity in Shay rats, histamine-induced ulcer in guinea pigs and in aspirin-induced ulcer in rats. Andrographolide possessed significant (p<0.05) antiulcerogenic activity at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg bw administered orally in aspirin-induced ulceration in rats. The dry leaf powder when fed orally to male albino rats, at a dose level of 20 mg powder per day for 60d, resulted in cessation of spermatogenesis, degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules, regression of Leydig cells and regressive and/or degenerative changes in the epididymis, seminal vesicle, ventral prostate and coagulating gland. The aqueous extract of the plant at a dose of 20 mg/100g bw orally in rats inhibited carrageenin-induced oedema (65.3 per cent) after three hours as compared to the control rats. Andrographolide was studied for its antiinflammatory activity in acute, subacute and chronic models of inflammation in rats after oral administration at doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg. It significantly inhibited carrageenin-kaolin-and nystatin-induced paw oedema in rats. The plant juice (2ml/100g bw orally) showed antipyretic activity in yeast-induced pyrexia in rats. The extract administered even after 5h of year also reduced pyrexia. Andrographolide (100 and 300 mg/kg bw orally) produced a significant (p<0.05) antipyretic effect 3h of administration in Brewers yeast-induced pyrexia in rats. Andrographolide at 300 mg/kg dose administered orally showed significant (p<0.05) analgesic activity in acetic acid-induced writhing in mice and Randall Selittoâs test in rats. The water decoction of the leaves was tested both in vitro and vivo against canine filariasis. The decoction killed in vitro the microfilariae Dipetalonema reconditum in 40 min. Three injections of the extract into infected dogs at 0.06 ml/g bw s.c. reduced the number of microfilariae in blood by more than 85 per cent. The alcoholic extract of the plant exhibited significant antidiarrhoeal activity against Escherichia coli enterotoxins in animal models. The activity was further located in n-butanol fraction, which contained four diterpenes, andrographolide, neoandrographolide, deoxyandrographolide and andrographiside. Andrographolide significantly decreased degranulation of mast cells of rats and reduced liberation of histamine from the cells when tested in vitro at concentration of 30, 100 and 300 Âµg/ml. It was found to produce an increase in delayed hypersensitivity in rats. The alcoholic extract of the plant was found to possess schizontocidal activity (39.26 per cent) in vivo as well as (46.23 per cent) in vitro at a dose of 1g/kg 4d and 100 Âµg/ml. respectively against the NK 65 strain of Plasmodium berghei in Mastomys natalensis. The ethanolic extract and purified diterpene andrographolide induced significant stimulation of antibody and delayed type hypersensitivity response to sheep red blood cells in mice. The plant preparations also stimulated non specific immune response of the animals measured in terms of macrophage migration index (MMI), phagocytosis of P1114P11C-leucine labeled I11Escherichia coliI11 and proliferation of splenic lymphocytes. The stimulation of both antigen specific and non specific immune response was however of lower order with andrographolide than with the ethanolic extract, suggesting thereby that substance(s) other than andrographolide present in the extract might also be contributing towards immunostimulation. The alcoholic and aqueous extracts of the leaves showed antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Escherichia coliI11. The 80 per cent ethanolic extract of the root using the Agar diffusion method revealed antibacterial activity against a strain I11Escherichia coli I11 and I11Pseudomonas aeruginosa I11 at a concentration of 25 mg/ml. It was also active against I11Bacillus subtilis I11 and I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 in concentration of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/ml, respectively. The extract of the plant revealed antifungal activity against I11Helminthosporium sativumI11 and inhibited the mycelial growth of the keratinophilic fungi I11Microsporum gypseum, Chrysosporium tropicumI11 and I11Trichophyton terrestreI11 in in vitro studies. The alcoholic and the aqueous extracts of the plant showed antifungal activity against I11Aspergillus nigerI11 at concentration of 5 and 2.5 per cent. The effect of the alcoholic extract of the plant (at a dose of 100 mg/25g i.p. and 50 mg.25 g.i.p) on cobra venom-induced death in mice was studied. The extract prolonged the life time of venom injected animals as compared to the controls (saline). The extract prolonged the life time of cobra victims by an unknown mechanism.

Attempts were made to obtain andrographolide were reported in pure form and various methods for estimation of andrographolide were reported (Bandyopadhyay et al., 1986; Chauhan et al., 1999). Four diterpenes, andrographolide, neoandrographolide, deoxyandrographolide and andrographiside were isolated from the I11nI11-butanol fraction of the alcoholic extract of the plant. The methanol soluble portion of the benzene extract of the plant yielded carvacrol and eugenol along with myristic acid, hentriacontane and tritriacontane (Ojha, 1983). Tissue culture studies to enhance the andrographolide contents were carried out. Eight cytotypes of I11A. paniculataI11 were analyzed for andrographolide content spectrophotometrically and it was found that a cytotypes obtained from Jessore in Bangladesh gave highest yield. The root yielded a new flavone (5-hydroxy-7, 8, 2â, 3â-tetramethoxyflavone) found to be identical with mono- I11OI11-methylwightin along with apigenin-7,4â-di- I11OI11-methyl ether and andrographolide (Govindachari et al., 1969); two new flavonoids, 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-3,7,8,2â-tetramethoxyflavone in addition to the known flavonoid, 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone (7- I11OI11-methylwogonin); a new glycoside, 2â,5- dihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone-2â- I11OI11- Ã-D-glucoside, and 3 Ã-hydroxy-5-stigmasta 9(11), 22(23)-diene.

Antifertility action has also been shown. The effect of polyphenolics obtained from fresh unripe areca nuts was studied on rat uterus under various hormonal influences and compared with the effects obtained with alkaloidal fractions. The total aqueous extract and the aqueous residue after ethyl acetate extraction, which gave positive reaction to alkaloids, were spasmogens of the uterine musculature in all phases of oestrous and hormonal influences. The ethyl acetate fraction of the aqueous fraction of the aqueous extract was a stimulant of low degree on all uteri but its spasmogenic activity was comparatively more on uteri treated with progesterone. The absence of uterine contraction after oestrogen and stimulation after progesterone was markedly observed with polymerized fractions of the areca nut. The alcoholic extract of the nuts exerted distinct oxytocic activity on isolated rats uterus at a dose of 100Âµg. The oil from the nuts when administered from days 1-7 post coitum at a dose of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg bw to female albino rats prevented pregnancy in 60 per cent and 80 per cent of rats, respectively, while the oil at a dose of 500 mg/kg bw exerted resorption of implants, since the one rat having implantation sites on day 10 of pregnancy did not deliver at the completion of the term. In a preliminary study, the 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the leaves was found to be devoid of hypoglycaemic action in mice. But subcutaneous administration of the alkaloid fraction of areca nut to diabetic rabbits showed that at the dosage of 0.20 and 0.25 mg/kg bw there was a reduction of about 50 per cent in blood sugar level. The crude betel nut extract and its constituent polyphenols applied locally and given orally promoted healing in incision as well as dead space wounds in male Wistar rats. In addition, they promoted epithelisation in excision wounds. Lectins from the betel nut exhibited haemagglutination pattern with various normal and enzyme treated red cells. The aqueous, alcoholic, alkaline and acid extracts of areca nuts caused constriction of capillaries to varying degrees when tested by rat hind limb perfusion technique. The water extract of areca but potentiated the adrenaline action both in intensity and duration on rat hind limb preparation. The soluble fractions present in the supernatant of the alcohol, alkali, acid and aqueous extracts as also the sediments were spasmogens on the isolated ileum and uterus of the rat. The soluble fractions showed these effects due to the presence of alkaloids and few of the polymerized components, termed phlobaphenes. Arecoline in a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p. induced slight sedation in rats at the end of 5 min in maze learning technique. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the leaves showed effects on respiration and CVS in cat./dog, and antispasmodic activity on isolated guinea pig ileum. The aqueous extract of the nuts inhibited the growth of I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Trichophyton rubrumI11 in vitro, while the alcoholic extract inhibited the growth of I11Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, C. tropicalisI11 and I11Trichophyton interdigitaleI11, Arecoline did not inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 2 per cent concentration, while the aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts inhibited the growth even in 1/10,000 dilution. The ethyl acetate fraction, consisting of leucocyanidin, catechin and other unidentified polyphenols and the oxidized and polymerized compounds exhibited varying degree of antibacterial activity. The acetone extract of the fruits revealed antifungal activity by inhibiting the conidial germination of I11Pyricularia oryzaeI11 and I11Colletotrichum falcatum,I11 the casual agents of blast of rice and red rot of sugarcane, respectively. The action of the extract of nuts on human blood leucocytes in vitro revealed that the extract had a depressing effect on normal phagocytic function. The rats showed severe diarrhoea and died within 1-3 wk depending upon the amount of betel nut meal consumed. The foetotoxic potential of betel nuts was studied in Swiss albino mice using total aqueous extracts if ripe betel nuts of unprocessed and processed varieties when administered to pregnant animals at dose levels of 1, 3 and 5 mg/day/mouse (weighing 27Â±1g) through days of 6-15 gestation. The treatments resulted in increased resorptions as well as dead foetuses. Occurrence of leukoplakia and tumours in hamster buccal pouches after chronic topical application of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) extract of betel nut alone and in combination with tobacco were studied applying the extract three times a week for 21 wk. Betel nut alone resulted in the development of tumours in 38 per cent and leukoplakia in 90 per cent of animals, while the combined extracts resulted in the development of tumours in 76 per cent of the group. Betel nut aqueous extract, polyphenol fraction and tannic acid increased glutathione content, while, protein-SH and protein âSH and protein âSH +SS contents were decreased in different tissues. Arecoline decreased glutathione, protein-SH and protein -SH+SS contents in various tissues of Swiss mice. The observed decrease in glutathione level on treatment with arecoline might be first stage in the exposure of organism to carcinogenic principle from betel nut. Sun dried Mangalore betel nut extract in water and in DMSO and sun-cured Vadakkan tobacco extract in DMSO, were tested for their carcinogenicity. On subcutaneous administration of betel nut extract, 60 per cent of Swiss mice developed transplantable fibrosarcomas at the site of injection, Skin application of DMSO extracts of tobacco and of betel nut separately did not result in skin lesions in C17 mice; but when a mixed DMSO extract of tobacco and betel nut was used, skin papillomas and epidermoid carcinoma developed in some animals. In a study on carcinogenicity of some folk medicinal herbs, the total aqueous extract of areca nut in 72 subcutaneous injections administered weekly was reported to produce local tumours in 100 per cent of outbred black rats. Carcinogenicity of different preparations of betel nut in mice viz., ripe-unprocessed-sun dried nut, ripe-processed-sun dried nut, unripe-processed-sun dried nut, ripe-unprocessed-sundried water soaked nut and ripe-unprocessed undried water soaked nut, following diet-feeding or oral feeding for 12 months showed that only oral feeding unprocessed betel nuts at high doses displayed a very weak carcinogenicity. Swiss mice were injected (i.p.) with different constituents of betel nut like betel nut aqueous extract, polyphenol fraction and arecoline. All the above studied constituents were observed to increase DNA biosynthesis and RNase activity in different tissues. Aqueous extract of betel nut of North-East India induced DNA-strand breaks and enhanced rate of mouse kidney cells proliferation in vitro. It was also found to be able to enhance the rate of cell division at a dose of 100Âµg/ml while at higher dose of 250Âµg/ml was extremely toxic to the cells. Presence of aflatoxins in foods and feeds available in Tamil Nadu were studied. A total of 147 samples, consisting of scented âsupariâ (67 samples), broken processed areca nut (54 samples) and areca nut sample were found to contain aflatoxins. In a study on tannins in betel nut and its products consumed in India, the betel nuts as well as the other materials consumed in betel quid were reported to contain high levels of condensed tannins, which could cause nutritional problems, especially for people whose diets were only marginally adequate. C11ToxicologyC11 Development of tumour in animals by the extract of arecanut is reported. Chewing of betel quid (excluding tobacco) enhances levels of nitrite in oral cavity, which may promote increased generation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. Arecoline in very large doses depresses the central nervous system and paralyzes the muscles. C11Clinical StudiesC11 In an epidemiological study in North-East India, the demography and aetiology of cancer of hypo pharynx and larynx with special reference to betel nut chewing habit was studied. The relative frequency of cancer based on examination of biopsy tissues was assessed. The local raw betel nut chewing habit was found to be of considerable significance especially among the females in the causaton of hypopharyngeal cancer. A relationship between betel quid chewing and buccal mucosa cancer was studied in patients of South India. Out of the 3529 new cancer patients, 362 were buccal mucosa or gingiva. Detailed history of the patients, clinical examination and histopathology showed there was evidence for direct contact of the betel quid with the development of mucosal cancer. Powder of Areca catechu, Samalia malabarica, Mimusops Elengi, Woodfordia fruticosa and Cichorium intybus were used in the form of vaginal tablets in single blind technique in twenty five patients of vaginal discharge. Significant improvement was observed in 15 days of treatment. AC-4, a composite drug containing Embelia ribes, Laccardia lacca, Areca catechu and Saraca asoca in equal parts, when administered orally (1g/day in two divided doses) to 281 women for 15 days (4th day of menstrual cycle to 18th day) exhibited good contraceptive activity. There was no pregnancy due to drug failure after 10th cycle. No toxic symptoms or severe side effects were noticed.

A detailed analysis, however, revealed that the young and mature nuts contained (+)-catechin and leucocyanidin. In another study, it was found that polymeric proanthocyanidins dominated and their separation by simple means was difficult and therefore, a combination of methods was used for their separation. There was considerable variation in the stage of polymerization depending on the maturity of the nuts. The tannins of the tender, mature and ripe nuts were analyzed. The percentage of tannins in the three nuts was 44.09, 40.35 and 38.56 per cent, respectively. Besides these, the extracts of the nuts were found to contain (+)-catechin and a dextrorotatory isomer of leucocyanidin (5, 7, 3â, 4â-tetrahydroxyflavan-3, 4-diol). The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the leaves in another study was devoid of tannins in a preliminary chemical study. The chemical analysis of the nuts showed the presence of moisture, tannins, fats and other insolubles (42.4 per cent) (Banerjee et al., 1960). The fatty acid analysis of areca nut fat revealed the chief component acids as lauric (19.5 per cent), myristic (46.2 per cent), and palmitic (1.7 per cent) and the unsaturated acids as oleic (6.2 per cent), lineoleic (5.4 per cent) and hexadecenoic (7.2 per cent) acids, Minor proportions of stearic, decenoic and of unsaturated monoethylenic CB1112B11 and CB1114B11 acids were also present. The chief component glycerides were 56 per cent of fully saturated (trimyristin, dimyristin and lauromyristopalmitin); 30 per cent of mono-unsaturated-disaturated (mainly hexadecenolauromyristin with some oleo-(linoleo) mysristopalmitins and dimyristins) and 14 per cent of diunsaturated-monosaturated (oleolinoleoglycerides, mostly oleolinoleopalmitin). The fully saturated components were found to contain 19.4 per cent of stearic acids. The occurrence of Ã-sitosterol in the nut was reported. Ripe and semi-ripe areca nuts obtained from Kerala were found to have a large number of amino acids both in free and combined state. The distinguishing features of the amino acid make up were absence or insignificant quantity of tryptophan and methionine, presence of high percentage of proline in both free and combined forms and relative increase of free tyrosine and phenylalanine and of combined arginine in the semi-ripe and ripe nuts. Various aspects of areca nut have been reviewed by Arjungi (1976).", "uses": [{"disease": "Burns", "part_used": "Fruit"}, {"disease": "Kidney stone", "part_used": "Fruit"}, {"disease": "Kidney stone", "part_used": "Seed"}, {"disease": "Toothache", "part_used": "Fruit"}, {"disease": "Veneral diseases", "part_used": "Fruit"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/46/1/46.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/46/2/46.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Areca catechu</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Areca catechu </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Areca nut (English) ,Betel nut tree (English) ,Betel Palm (English) ,Cashoo Nut Tree (English) ,Catechu Palm (English) ,Catechu Tree (English) ,Drunken Date Tree (English) ,Fasel Nut (English) ,Fauselnut Tree (English) ,Medicinal Cabbage Tree (English) ,Supari (Hindi) ,Suppari (Hindi) ,Supyari (Hindi) ,Akota (Sanskrit) ,Akotaja (Sanskrit) ,Chhataphala (Sanskrit) ,Chikkana (Sanskrit) ,Dirghapadapa (Sanskrit) ,Dridhavalkala (Sanskrit) ,Ghonta (Sanskrit) ,Gopadala (Sanskrit) ,Gubak (Sanskrit) ,Guvaaka (Sanskrit) ,Kabukah (Sanskrit) ,Kapitana (Sanskrit) ,Karamattam (Sanskrit) ,Khapura (Sanskrit) ,Kramuka (Sanskrit) ,Kramukah (Sanskrit) ,Kramukam (Sanskrit) ,Kuvara (Sanskrit) ,Phalam (Sanskrit) ,Pooga (Sanskrit) ,Puga (Sanskrit) ,Pugah (Sanskrit) ,Puga-Phalam (Sanskrit) ,Pugi (Sanskrit) ,Rajatala (Sanskrit) ,Suranjana (Sanskrit) ,Tambula (Sanskrit) ,Tantusara (Sanskrit) ,Udvegam (Sanskrit) ,Valkataru (Sanskrit) ,Adake (Kannada) ,Adaki (Kannada) ,Adike (Kannada) ,Adike mara (Kannada) ,Betta (Kannada) ,Bettadike (Ka</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>L.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Family : </b>Arecaceae</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Basic Description of Plant : </b>Monoecious, perennial trees.

The antifertility and antimicrobial actions of argemone lose importance due to its potential toxicity. The effects of two alkaloids berberine and sanguinarine was studied in vitro on human pregnancy plasma diamine oxidase (histaminase). At a concentration of 5x 10P11-6P11 mole both the alkaloids inhibited more than 50 per cent activity of the enzyme. The three isoquinoline alkaloids characterized from the seeds viz., dihydropalmatine hydroxide (I), berberine (II) and protopine (III) when administered to male dogs at a dose level of 30 mg/kg for 70d induced inhibition of spermatogenesis at the stage XII of late spermatids. The aqueous extract of the leaves at the doses of 30, 60 and 120 mg/kg i.p. possessed significant antiinflammatory activity against carrageenin-induced rat paw oedema. The crude latex of the plant showed low grade anticoagulant activity and normal fibrinolysis in rabbit plasma. The total alkaloidal fraction obtained from the root and the stem produced a fall in blood pressure of anesthetized dogs at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg and more. Protopine fraction produced a rise in blood pressure in smaller concentrations and fall in higher doses. Berberine fraction produced only a fall in blood pressure. The respiration was stimulated by total alkaloidal fraction when given intravenously. The total alkaloids also stimulated the smooth muscles and antagonized the action of acetylcholine, histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant in preliminary biological screening revealed effect on respiration in dog/cat and antiviral activity against Ranikhet disease virus. Both the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of the fruits showed antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The extract in another study was active against I11Bacillus pumilus (+), Pseudomonas mangiferae indicae (-), Salmonella paratyphi (-), Staphylococcus albus (+)I11 and I11Xanthomonas campestris (-).I11 The oil obtained from the plant showed in vitro antibacterial activity by various methods against I11Micrococcus pyogenes var. aureus, Mic pyogenes var. albus, Mic pyogenes var. citreus, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Salmonella typhosa, Salm paratyphi I11A and B, I11Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgarisI11and I11Pseudomonas pyocyanea.I11 The crude extract of the root showed antifungal activity against I11Helminthosporium sativumI11 (94.5 per cent), I11Colletotrichum falcatumI11 (81.5 per cent) and I11Fusarium oxysporumI11 (78.0 per cent). The aqueous extract of the leaves showed moderate antifungal activity in treated bananas infested with I11Botryodiplodia theobramae, Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium speciferum, Curvularia lunata, Aspergillus flavus and Trichothecium roseumI11 (causing banana root- rot). In ringworm fungi, the extract of the leaves showed moderate activity against I11Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum gypseumI11 while the poor activity against I11Epidermophyton floccosum.I11 The extract of the healthy twigs/ whole plant was found to have antifungal activity against I11Penicillium chrysogenum, P. notatum, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp. and Curvularia tuberculata.I11 The extract of the bark was found to have some antiviral activity against potato virus X. The juice obtained from the seeds inhibited the infectivity of top necrosis virus of pea. The crude extract of the leaves showed 59.22 per cent inhibition of groundnut mosaic virus I11in vitro.I11 The extract of the shoots inhibited the larvae of I11Meloidogyne javanicaI11 infesting the leaves of ladyâs finger. The oil obtained from the seeds showed nematicidal activity against the larvae of I11Meloidogyne incognitaI11 when applied to soil or to the leaves of inoculated ladyâs finger plants. Exposure to 40 per cent and 80 per cent sublethal concentrations (24h LC B1150 B11) of the molluscicidal components protopine and sanguinarine from the plant revealed a significant decrease in the levels of protein, free amino acid, DNA and RNA in the nervous tissue of I11Lymnae acuminata.I11 Argemone oil is more toxic than certain brand oils viz., olive oil and liquid paraffin, but if the oil is heated to a stage at which it fumes well (at 240ÂºC for 15 min), its toxicity was not much more than that of the brand oils or liquid paraffin. Pure argemone oil administered orally, injected or painted on the ratâs skin produced capillary reaction only on the skin; the oil or the products of its breakdown were excreted chiefly if not exclusively through the skin. Controlled studies on the toxicity of argemone oil carried out in monkeys, suggested that 0.05 ml of the oil/kg bw was associated with some toxic manifestations, while 0.025 ml/kg bw did not produce any toxic symptoms over a period of 60d. The effect of argemone oil feeding on blood biochemistry and tissue changes in albino rats of both sexes was studied. Histopathological changes in liver showed increased fibrosis, hyperplasia of bile ducts and congestion in a few portal tracts. Lings of argemone oil fed animals indicated congestion and thickening of interalveolar septa. Alveolar spaces were disorganized and irregular. Kidneys showed vascular and glomerular congestion and patchy tubular lesions. Parenteral administration of argemone oil (5ml/kg bw) daily for 3d produced a significant increase in both non-enzymatic and NADPH-supported enzymatic lipid peroxidation in whole homogenate, mitochondria and microsomes in rats. The total alkaloids of argemone on i.p. or s.c administration in rats for 3 to 6 wk produced ascites, diarrhoea, loss of hair and loss of weight in 66 per cent of rats. The alkaloids stimulated the growth of vessels which formed a dense plexus very prone to haemorrhage. A number of reviews featuring the epidemiology, toxicology, clinical features, treatment, chemistry, pharmacognosy of I11A. mexicanaI11 have appeared from time to time. The aetiology, pathophysiology, mechanism, diagnosis, prognosis and prevention of epidemic dropsy due to argemone oil has been dealt in some of the reviews: Chakravarthi (1953); Thatte and Dahanukar (1999); Sharma et al., (1999); Bhatt and Krishnamachari (1978). Experimental production of syndrome of epidemic dropsy in human beings (Bhatia and Malaviya, 1951) was made in order to study the exact mechanism of epidemic dropsy. C11Clinical Studies C11 Clinical studies including case reports have been carried out on a various aspects of epidemic dropsy. While only the references are being given no details are being covered. These are the cutaneous manifestations; optic disc vasculitis; ocular manifestations; cardiovascular manifestations (Sanghvi, 1960); hepatomegaly (hepatic alterations); hypermelanosis of the skin; pigmentation, hair loss and non-tender hepatomegaly; sedimentation rate of blood cells. There have been a number of records of epidemic dropsies in different parts of the country as a result of consumption of edible oils adulterated with argemone oil, which is either mixed accidentally or purposefully. Ingestion of this contaminated oil can often lead to fatal epidemic dropsy. The liver, heart, kidney and lungs are the major target organs of the toxins (the alkaloids sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine) and damage is mostly caused by free radical (singlet oxygen) and hydroxyl radical to the cell membranes. A large number of epidemics have occurred all over India. Some of these were the epidemic dropsy in Surada, a village in Ganjam district; West Bengal; Bombay; Chandrapur (Maharashtra ); Sirpur Kaghaznagar township of Andhra Pradesh; North Delhi; Palam area of Delhi; Rajasthan; Barbanki district of Uttar Pradesh; Trans Yamuna areas of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

This was the first report of the isolation of (Â± )-cheilanthifoline from the species (Tripathi et al., 1999). From the latex of the plant berberine (0.74 per cent) and two bases were isolated. One of the bases was identified as protopine. In addition, presence of I11LI11-glutamine, hydroxyproline, threonine, Ã-alanine and methionine was also indicated (Santra and Saoji, 1971). The stem revealed the presence of protopine and berberine. Besides the alkaloids, other constituents found were tannins, resins and an unidentified toxic principle in the oil (Bose et al., 1963). The petroleum ether extract of the flowers was found to contain isorhamnetin (4â, 5, 7- trihydroxy-3â-methoxyflavonol) and two of its glycosides, isorhamnetin-3-glucoside and isorhamnetin-3,7-diglucoside. Seasonal variations of flavonol glycosides in the flowers. In addition. The flowers contained 3-methoxyquercetin and vanilic acid. The chloroform extract of the flowers was found to contain cryptopine and Ã-sitosterol. The ethanolic extract of the leaves when fractionated with petroleum ether and ethyl acetate revealed the presence of Ã-amyrin in the petroleum ether fraction and isorhamnetin-3-glucoside in the ethyl acetate fraction. The aqueous layer revealed the presence of cysteine and phenylalanine. Two new aliphatic compounds were isolated from the leaves which were identified as 6, 11-triacontanediol (mexicanol) and 10-hydroxyheptadec- I11cisI11-4-enoic (mexicanic acid). The earliest report on the chemical investigation on the plant was the study of Argemone oil from which a colourless crystalline free base, representing a part of the complex molecule of the toxic substance present in the oil was isolated. Chemical composition of argemone oil and reported two physiologically active alkaloids. The major alkaloid was identified as dihydrosanguinarine (87 per cent of the total alkaloids) and the other alkaloid was identified a sanguinarine (5 per cent of the total alkaloids). (Misra et al., 1961a) isolated these alkaloids in an yield of 2 per cent from the oil. The seed oil, in addition, was found to contain 1 per cent hydroxy, 2 per cent (mostly I11cisI11, but possibly some I11transI11) epoxy and keto fatty acids besides myristic (0.5 per cent), palmitic (14.9 per cent), oleic (29.2 per cent) and linoleic (55.4 per cent) acids. Three other fatty acids were isolated from the seed oil, two of which were characterized as 11-oxotriacontanoic acid and 11- hydroxytriacontanoic acid and the third fatty acid namely argemonic acid was an unusual long chain fatty acid identified as (+)-6-hydroxy-6-methyl-9-oxo-octacosanoic acid. The seed oil samples from Jamaica and India on reverse phase chromatography revealed the presence of myristic (0,1), palmitic (9,12), stearic (5,5), arachidic (0,1),oleic (33,23) and linoleic 1-2 per cent, if present. Two new phenolic compounds 5,7,2â6â-tetrahydroxyflavone (argemexitin) and 5, 7-dihydroxychromone 7-neohesperidoside were isolated from the seeds (Bhardwaj et al., 1982).", "uses": [{"disease": "Boils", "part_used": "Seed"}, {"disease": "Pimples", "part_used": "Seed"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/48/1/48.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/48/2/48.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Argemone mexicana</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Argemone mexicana </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Mexican poppy (English) ,Prickly poppy (English) ,Thorn poppy (English) ,Yellow mexican poppy (English) ,Yellow prickly poppy (English) ,Yellow thistle (English) ,Bharband (Hindi) ,Bharbhand (Hindi) ,Bhatbhamt (Hindi) ,Bhiladhutura (Hindi) ,Brahmadundi (Hindi) ,Brahmi (Hindi) ,Farangidhutura (Hindi) ,Firanghee-Dhatura (Hindi) ,Kandiari (Hindi) ,Kateli (Hindi) ,Pharamgi Dhattura (Hindi) ,Pila-Dhatura (Hindi) ,Satiyanashi (Hindi) ,Shial Kanta (Hindi) ,Shialkanta (Hindi) ,Shiyal-Kanta (Hindi) ,Suchianas (Hindi) ,Ujarkanta (Hindi) ,Ujar-Kanta (Hindi) ,Brahmadandi (Sanskrit) ,Brahmandanti (Sanskrit) ,Bramhi (Sanskrit) ,Brumadandie (Sanskrit) ,Canaksiri (Sanskrit) ,Darudi (Sanskrit) ,Haimavathi (Sanskrit) ,Hemadugdha (Sanskrit) ,Hemashikha (Sanskrit) ,Hemavati (Sanskrit) ,Hemavha (Sanskrit) ,Kancani (Sanskrit) ,Kanchanakehiri (Sanskrit) ,Kanchani (Sanskrit) ,Karhini (Sanskrit) ,Katuparni (Sanskrit) ,Kshirini (Sanskrit) ,Ksiraparni (Sanskrit) ,Patuparni (Sanskrit) ,Pitadugdha (Sanskrit) ,Pitapushpa (Sanskrit) ,Rukmi</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>L.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Family : </b>Papaveraceae</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Basic Description of Plant : </b>A herb or undershrub.

The extract also exhibited antispasmodic activity on the isolated guinea pig ileum. The alcoholic extract of the leaves revealed antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 but was inactive against I11Escherichia coliI11. The aqueous extract was inactive against both the bacteria.

In another study, the seed oil revealed the presence of myristoleic, myristic, palmitic, linolenic, oleic, stearic, nonadecanoic, eicosenoic, heneicosanoic and behenic acids identified as their corresponding methyl ester through GLC. Presence of branched fatty acids 12-methylmyristic acid and 15-methylstearic acid was also reported (Batra and Mehta, 1985). The fruits were reported to contain I11nI11-triacontanol, Ã-sitosterol, I11pI11-hydroxycinnamoyl octadecanolate and caffeic acid (Purshothaman et al., 1982). The petroleum ether extracts of the leaves yielded 1-triacontanol, epifriedelinol acetate, epifriedelinol and Ã-sitosterol (Sahu and Chakravarthi, 1971). The leaves were found rich in quercetin. Extraction of the leaves with 90 per cent methanol led to the isolation of flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol together with the latterâs glycoside kaempferol 3- I11OI11-L-rhamnopyranoside (Khan et al., 1992).

Chloroform soluble acidic fraction of ethanolic extract showed interceptive activity in mice and hamster, which could be reversed by exogenous administration of progesterone and prolactin. A sesquiterpene isolated from the root exerted interceptive activity and antiimplantation activity in adult mice and antioestrogenic activity in immature female mice. Ethanolic and petroleum ether extracts inhibited estrogen production, and eventually produced sterility in female rats. Aristolic acid was found to be antioestrogenic and has antiimplantation effect in mice. It interfered with steroidal conditioning of the uterus and rendered it unsuitable for ovum implantation. A methyl ester of aristolic acid showed abortifacient activity. p-Coumaric acid isolated from the plant showed interceptive activity. It induced alteration in estrus cycle, ovarian and uterine weight and had no marked effect on the estrogen-primed immature female mice. It also caused loss of libido, decrease in weight of testis and accessory sex organs, decrease in fructose content of coagulating gland and reduction in acid phosphatase activity in prostrate, which could be reversed by administration of prolactin and testosterone propionate. p- Coumaric acid showed high margin of safety (>1000mg/kg) and did not show teratogenic effect. The ethanolic extract of root showed antimicrobial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Escherichia coli.I11 Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of root showed cytotoxic activity against KB cell lines (EDB1150B11 3 to 5Âµg/ml) and against adenocarcinoma 755 as well as against lymphocytic luekaemia PB11388B11 in vivo. Aristolochic acid showed mutagenic activity in Ameâs test while aristolic and aristolactam acid were not mutagenic. Aristolochic acid acted as a competitive inhibitor of phospholipase AB112B11 enzyme in snake venom. It also inhibited the oedema-inducing activity of phospholipase AB112B11 obtained from human synovial fluid. The methyl ester of aristolic acid produced damage to liver and kidney. The treated animal also exhibited cannibalism. The crude petroleum ether, chloroform and alcoholic extracts of the root administered orally at the single dose of 100 mg/kg bw given at the post implantation period showed 100 per cent interceptive activity in mature female mice. The aqueous, alcoholic and petroleum ether extracts of the root at 1:20 concentration affected the oestrous cycle adversely ending at the dioestrous stage in female Wistar rats. The water soluble acidic part of the alcoholic extract of the root showed 100 per cent interceptive activity at a single dose of 50 mg/kg orally in mice and hamsters. No such activity was observed in the case of rats in which there was only delayed parturition. Aristolic acid isolated from the root given in the dose of 60 mg/kg bw prevented oestrogen-induced weight increase and epithelial growth of mouse uterus. A single oral dose of aristolic acid at the dose levels of 120 and 90 mg/kg on day 1 or day 6 of pregnancy in mouse resulted in a rise of acid phosphates and fall of alkaline phosphatase and protein in uterus in both groups. The methyl ester of aristolic acid isolated from the root was found to exert 100 per cent abortifacient activity at a single oral dose of 60 mg/kg bw when administered on sixth or seventh day of pregnancy in mice; 20 and 25 per cent abortifacient activities were observed at the same dose on day 10 and 12 post coitum, respectively in the animals. The water soluble part of the chloroform fraction of the root when fed orally at a dose of 75 mg/kg caused degenerative changes of varying degrees in the seminiferous germinal cell components with prominent nuclear degeneration in all cell types. There was a significant reduction in the fluid content in the accessory sex organs of the experimental mice indicating an impaired endocrine function of the testis. In adult male rats, oral administration of p-coumaric acid in doses of 50 mg/kg/day for 56d produced complete loss of libido, significant decrease in the weight of the testis and accessory sex organs, decrease in the fructose content of the coagulating gland and a reduction in the acid phosphatase activity in the prostrate. The water soluble portion of the alcoholic extract of the plant at a dose of 100 mg/100g i.p. administered in albino rats for 16d was found to exhibit antiinflammatory action. Aristolic acid was not found mutagenic to bacterial system. On the other hand aristolochic acid, analogue of aristolic acid, was mutagenic. The juice of the root was found to have relaxant effect on the rhythmic contractions of uteri of rats and human beings. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant in a preliminary biological screening revealed diuretic activity in rat. The ethanolic extract of the root showed antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Escherichia coliI11 while the aqueous extract found to be devoid of any activity against both the organisms. The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the seeds in vitro studies were devoid of antimicrobial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococuss aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Strept viridans.

The oil also contained ishwarene, ishwarone and ishwarol (Krishna Rao et al., 1935). Presence of (+) camphor and ledol was also reported in the oil. From the air dried plant, isolation of methyl ester of 12-nonacosenoic acid was reported for the first time. The phenanthrene alkaloids aristolochic acid, aristolochine, and other polysubstituted phenanthrene derivatives are the significant constituents of the plant. The alkaloid, aristolochine and the sesquiterpene ishwarone (Krishnarao et al.,, 1935) were later identified as I11lI11-curine and as novel tetracyclic sesquiterpene ketone based on remophilane skeleton, respectively. The absolute stereochemistry of ishwarone was established by chemical correlation (+)-nootkane, as also based on spectral and chemical evidence l; The structure of ishwarol was assigned in correlation with the structure of ishwarone. Further, three new sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, ishwarane, aristolochene and 5ÃH, 7 Ã,10? -selina-4(14),11-diene were isolated from the oil. Besides aristolochic acid, aristolochic acid-D and aristolactam- Ã-D-glucoside are reported, five more phenanthrene derivatives hitherto unknown in nature were isolated from the root. These were compound A, an ester; compound B designated as aristolic acid; compound C designated as aristolamide; compound D and compound E designated as methyl aristolochate. In addition, stigmast-4-en-3-one, not reported from any Aristolochia species so far; sitosterol; two uncharacterized isomeric sesquiterpene alcohols and I11pI11-coumaric acid were also reported (Pakrashi et al., 1977). Two isomeric sesquiterpene alcohols (12S)-7,12-secoishwaran-12-ol and (+)-ledol; a phenanthrene derivative aristololactam N- Ã-D-glucoside and the steroids 3 Ã-hydroxystigmast05-en-7-one cepharadione A, aristololactam AII and Ã-sitosterol- Ã-D-glucoside; aristololide, a phenanthroid lactone, 5?-stigmastane-3-6-dione,(-)-cubebin and (-)-hinokinin were isolated from the root. The structure of 8-methyl-juglone, aristolindiquinone isolated earlier from the plant was established on the basis of its synthesis from I11OI11-ally- I11pI11-cresol. The 13C NMR spectra of compounds related to aristolochic acid and aristolactam were studied in detail to determine the chemical shifts and coupling constants of polysubstituted phenanthrenes (Achari et al., 1984).", "uses": [{"disease": "Allergy", "part_used": "Rhizome"}, {"disease": "Body ache", "part_used": "Stem/Bark"}, {"disease": "Insect bites", "part_used": "Rhizome"}, {"disease": "Itching", "part_used": "Rhizome"}, {"disease": "Menstrual disorder", "part_used": "Root"}, {"disease": "Menstrual disorder", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Menstrual disorder", "part_used": "Rhizome"}, {"disease": "Scabies", "part_used": "Rhizome"}, {"disease": "Scorpion sting", "part_used": "Rhizome"}, {"disease": "Skin diseases", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Snake bite", "part_used": "Rhizome"}, {"disease": "Stomach ache", "part_used": "Leaves"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/52/1/52.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/52/2/52.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Aristolochia indica</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Aristolochia indica </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Indian birthwort (English) ,Isarmul (Hindi) ,Isharmul (Hindi) ,Isharmul ki jar (Hindi) ,Isvarmul (Hindi) ,Ahiganda (Sanskrit) ,Ahigandha (Sanskrit) ,Arkamula (Sanskrit) ,Eeshvari (Sanskrit) ,Gandhanakuli (Sanskrit) ,Garalika (Sanskrit) ,Garudi (Sanskrit) ,Hari (Sanskrit) ,Ishvara (Sanskrit) ,Ishvari (Sanskrit) ,Isvaramula (Sanskrit) ,Jovari (Sanskrit) ,Karaleka (Sanskrit) ,Nakuleshtha (Sanskrit) ,Nakuli (Sanskrit) ,Rasna (Sanskrit) ,Rudrajata (Sanskrit) ,Sunanda (Sanskrit) ,Sunandahari (Sanskrit) ,Eeshvari balli (Kannada) ,Eeshwari Beru (Kannada) ,Eesvurberus (Kannada) ,Eswari Beru (Kannada) ,Gopalaputti Thoppalu (Kannada) ,Gopataputtitoppalu (Kannada) ,Isvaberusa (Kannada) ,Isvaraballi (Kannada) ,Isvaraberu (Kannada) ,Isvariberu (Kannada) ,Thoppalu (Kannada) ,Sapasan (Marathi) ,Sapasanda (Marathi) ,Garalavegam (Malayalam) ,Garudakkoti (Malayalam) ,Isvaramuli (Malayalam) ,Isvaramulla (Malayalam) ,Karalakam (Malayalam) ,Karalayam (Malayalam) ,Karukkapallu (Malayalam) ,Katalivegam (Malayalam) ,Perumarunna (Mala</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>L.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Family : </b>Aristolochiaceae</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Basic Description of Plant : </b>Woody twining, glabrous, perennial herbs.

The aqueous extract of the fruits caused immediate rise of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of anaesthetized dogs. The respiratory rate was increased but amplitude was diminished. The drug showed direct stimulant action on frog myocardium. A direct spasmogenic action on guinea pig and rabbit gut was shown by the extract. It also showed anthelmintic activity against tapeworms. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant in a preliminary biological screening was found to be devoid of antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, anthelmintic, antiviral, hypoglycaemic, diuretic and anticancer activities and effects on isolated guinea pig ileum, respiration, nictitating membrane, CVS and CNS in experimental animals, The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the freshly extracted essential oil (1:1000 dilution) from the air dried leaves was tested against seven bacteria and three fungi viz., I11Staphylococcus aureus, Staph aureusI11 (H57), I11Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, C. utilisI11 and I11Aspergillus nigerI11 by the serial dilution method. The extract was found to be active against I11Staphylococcus aureus, Staph aureusI11 (H57), I11Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 and I11Aspergillus niger.I11 The oil obtained from the leaves in the doses of 250, 500 and 1000 ppm showed different degree of fungitoxicity against various human pathogenic fungi viz., Absidia ramosa, I11Aspergillus fumigatusI11 (100 per cent), I11Blastomyces dermatidis, Microsporum canis, M. gallinae, M. ferrugineum, M. gypseumI11 (100 per cent), I11Epidermophyton floccosumI11 (100 per cent), I11Phialophora compactumI11 (100 per cent), I11P.jeansemei, P. melinii, P. pedrosoi, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, T. soudanenseI11 and I11T. violaceumI11 (100 per cent).

The oil contained I11pI11-cymene, (-)-linalool, Ã-thujone, an azulenen and Ã-thujyl alcohol (free and combined). The oil also contained an unidentified hydrocarbon. The oil resembled the commercially important American I11A. absinthiumI11 oil possessing aromatic and medicinal properties (Rao and Sood, 1964). In another study, the essential oil was reported to contain 1, 8-cineole, (+)-limonene, terpinolene, fenchone, (-)-thujone, thujyl alcohol, linalool, citral A and B, geraniol and aromadendrene. The study of oil from three different altitudes and climates viz., Nainital (ht 2010 m), Ratighat (ht (1320 m) and Garampani (ht 900 m) in Kumaun region revealed that lower altitude, rainfall and higher temperature favoured the formation of oxygenated compounds, while the higher altitude, rainfall and lower temperature favoured the formation of hydrocarbons but inhibited the formation of the essential oil from the plant (Sinha and Baslas, 1968). The physico-chemical constants of the oil from different localities were also reported. The oils extracted from the plants from Nepal and Bhutan were found to contain camphor (major component), (+)-limonene, S224-and Ã-pinene, Delta-carene, linalool, 1,8-cineol, thujone and citral. The chemical composition of the oil was compared with rosemary oil produced in United States. In view of the similarity in composition and aroma, the oil appeared to have a potential as substitute to rosemary oil used in perfumery. The plant collected from Almora, Pithorgarh and Jogeshwar of Kumaun hills yielded 0.3 â 0.45 per cent of essential oil. The essential oil from the aerial parts of the plant from Garhwal in Himalayas was reported to contain camphor Ã-eudesmol, 1, 8-cineol, borneol, Artemisia, camphene, Ã-pinene as the main constituents besides many other minor constituents (Uniyal et al., 1985). A new pentacyclic triterpene alcohol, fernenol was isolated from petroleum ether extract of the plant (Kundu et al, 1968). In addition, (-) thujone, stigmasterol, Ã-sitosterol, S224-amyrin and its acetate and three hydrocarbons designated as A, B and C were also obtained (Kundu et al., 1969). In a preliminary study, the leaves were reported to contain alkaloids, saponins and flavonoids while tannins were found to be absent The I11nI11âbutanol extractive of the dried leaves yielded an inositol whose structure was established as L-2-O âmethyl- I11chiroI11-inositol (L-quebrachitol) (Agarwal and Singh, 1994).", "uses": [{"disease": "Stomach ache", "part_used": "Root"}, {"disease": "Stomach ache", "part_used": "Leaves"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/56/1/56.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/56/2/56.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Artemisia nilagirica</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Artemisia nilagirica </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Fleabane (English) ,Indian worm wood (English) ,Dauna (Hindi) ,Davana (Hindi) ,Nagdona (Hindi) ,Damanah (Sanskrit) ,Damanakah (Sanskrit) ,Manjipatre (Kannada) ,Uravalu (Kannada) ,Urigattige (Kannada) ,Bathripoo (Tamil) ,Maasi patthiri (Tamil) ,Makkippu (Tamil) ,Marukozhunthu (Tamil) ,Masipattiri (Tamil) </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>(Clarke) Pampan.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Family : </b>Asteraceae</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Basic Description of Plant : </b>Perennial pubescent or villous, aromatic shrubs.

In higher doses (100-200 mg/kg i.v.), the animals developed ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia and ultimately died of ventricular fibrillation.

The plant has undergone extensive pharmacological investigations. The studies demonstrated that plant has significant beneficial effects in dyspepsia, acid-pepsin disease and deficient lactation. Anticancer and antistress effects need further studies. The cytoprotective effect of the powders of dry fruits of I11Terminalia chebulaI11 and root of I11A. racemosusI11 was studied on the experimentally induced acute gastric ulcerations. A mixture of the two drugs in a dose of 1.5g/kg each orally twice a day for 15d was effective in preventing formation of duodenal ulcer and diminishing the ulcer index in gastric lesions. In in vitro studies, the powder of the plant did not possess any antacid activity, Probably the beneficial effects of the plant in duodenal ulcer patient was due to direct healing effect or by enhancing the mucosal barrier by prolonging the life span of mucosal cells by cytoprotection. The effects of intramuscular administration [0.1ml (250mg/kg)] of the crude alcoholic extract of the root were studied in post partum, estrogen-primed non-primed rats. The extract increased the weight of mammary glands in post partum and estrogen-primed rats and the uterine weight in estrogen-primed group. The fresh root (1/2 kg/day) had a galactogogue action when given to buffaloes on 21st d after calving continued up to 50th d. The milk yield was found to be significantly increased after the use of the drug. Oral administration of the powdered root (100mg/kg/day for 10d) mixed with concentrate in normal lactating goats resulted in a substantial increase in the milk yield (7.33 per cent and 5.65 per cent increase during the drug and post drug period, respectively. The alcoholic extract of the root exhibited antioxytocic activity. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant (excluding root) revealed anticancer activity against human epidermoid carcinoma of nasopharynx in tissue culture. The powdered root extract revealed inhibitory action on DMBA-induced mammary tumourigenesis in rats of Holtzman strain. The mammary tumour incidence showed a sharp decline when virgin female rats, normal or primed with 17Ã-estradiol treatment were put on diets containing 0.25 per cent, 0.5 per cent, 1 per cent or 2 per cent root extract powder for 10d prior to their exposure to DMBA. The effect of the pretreatment of the decoction of the root (100mg/kg/day for 15d orally) was evaluated against I11Escherichia coliI11 induced peritonitis in mice. The results indicated 50 per cent mortality at 16h as compared to 100 per cent in the control animals, thus suggesting an immunomodulating property. The methanolic extract of the root at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg showed maximum inhibition of oedema of 18.6 per cent at 5h with serotonin-induced rat paw oedema, respectively. The antiinflammatory activity of the extract was comparable to that of phenylbutazone. The organic (250 mg dried ethanolic extract per kg bw) and the inorganic parts (90 mg pure ash/kg bw) of the root revealed hypoglycaemic activity in a single dose effect on the oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) in fasting albino rats. The aqueous extracts of both fresh and dried root were found to have amylase and lipase activities, the activity being higher in the former. The aqueous solution of the crude alcoholic extract of the root in a dose of 10-20 mg caused initial increase in force and rate of contraction in isolated frogâs heart a higher dose (40 mg) caused cardiac arrest. The decision of the root in a dose of 100 mg/kg bw for varying period of 4wk to 8 months showed growth promoting effects in rats. The decoction treated animals also showed a better weight gain (81.19 per cent) as compared to the control animals (67.9 per cent). It however, had no effect on the progeny of treated animals. The growth promoting effect was indicative of its anabolic effect and ascribed to its adaptogenic substances. The alcoholic extract of the root at a dose of 50 mg/kg (p.o.) revealed antiallergic activity as evidenced by inhibition of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mouse (57 per cent) and rat (53 per cent). The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant (excluding root) in a preliminary biological screening revealed antispasmodic activity on isolated guinea pig ileum and effect on guinea pig heart. The alcoholic extract of the root was found to possess in vitro antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Escherichia coliI11. The hexane, aqueous and alcoholic extracts of the root at concentration of 200 mg/ml were devoid of any in vitro antibacterial activity against I11Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosaI11 and I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 using the agar well diffusion test. The juice of the root showed fungitoxicity against three plant fungi viz., I11Helminthosporium sativumI11 (60.7 per cent), I11Colletotrichum falcatumI11 (58.2 per cent) and I11Fusarium oxysporumI11 (60.7 per cent). The root bark had marked antibacterial, antitubercular and antifungal actions against eight bacteria viz., I11Micrococcus pyogenes var. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhosa, Vibrio commaI11 and I11Shigella dysenteriaeI11; against two mycobacteria I11Mycobacterium phleiI11 and I11MycobacteriumI11 607; and against four fungi viz., I11Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Candida albicansI11 and I11Helminthosporium sativum.I11 The methanol fraction of the leaves using the disc diffusion test a concentration of 4000 and 5000 ppm was found to inhibit I11Proteus vulgarisI11 while it was devoid of any activity against I11Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenesI11 and I11Pseudomonas aerogenosaI11. The aqueous extract of the root was lethal or inhibitory, in in vitro studies to hatching of eggs of I11Meloidogyne javanicaI11 and I11M. arenaria.I11 C11Clinical StudiesC11 In a preliminary clinical trial, 23 patients having duodenal ulcers were given freshly expressed juice of the root in a dose of 25 ml with 10 ml honey 2-3 times/day for 45d. There was a complete relief in 14 patients, partial in 7 patients while 2 patients dropped out. There were no side effects. The clinical efficacy of the plants was evaluated in 32 patients with duodenal ulcers. The root powder (12.0/day in four divided doses) was given for an average duration of six weeks. The powder relieved symptoms in most of the patients within a week of therapy. 75 per cent of the patients had radiologic and endoscopic evidence of ulcer healing. In a clinical trial on twenty radiologically confirmed cases of duodenal ulcers (parinamasula) (15 cases having hyperchlorhydria and hyperacidity and 5 cases having normal gastric acidity) were given tuberous root powder 20g/day in three divided doses with milk for a month. The results indicated that there was a significant reduction in symptoms and total acids and free good response in 30 per cent cases of duodenal ulcer. The pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology and therapeutics of the plant were reviewed.

The fruits (green in colour) showed the presence of glycosides of quercetin, rutin and hyperoside, quercetin was found to be present as glycoside only. The fully ripe fruits (pink red in colour) contained anthocyanins viz., cyaniding-3-galactoside and cyaniding-3-glucorhamnoside (Subramnian and Nair, 1968a). The petroleum ether extract of the fruits was found to contain sitosterol, stigmasterol and sarsasapogenin, while the methanolic extract showed the presence of sitosterol Ã-D-glucoside, stigmasterol Ã-D-glucoside, two spirostanoilc and two furostanolic saponins. Although the saponins were not fully characterized but on acid hydrolysis, showed the presence of sarsasapogenin, D- glucose and L-rhamnose (Sharma et al., 1981). The leaves were found to contain rutin, a flavonoid glycoside as well as diosgenin (Subramanian and Nair, 1968a, b). The sapogenin present in the root was identified as sarsapogenin. The ethanolic extract of the woody portion of the tuberous root was found to contain kaempferol besides sarsasapogenin (Ahmad et al., 1991). The ethanolic extract of the root was shown to contain several steroidal glycosides named as shatavarins. Shatavarin-I, the major glycosidal component was characterized as (25S,22R)-3-Ã-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-[S224 -L-rhamnopyranosyl â(1-->2)-Ã-D-glucopyranoside-26- I11OI11 âÃ-D-glucopyranosyl -5Ã-furostane-3Ã, 22,26-triol. The presence of sitosterol, 4, 6-dihydroxy- I11OI11 â(2â-hydroxyisobutyl) benzaldehyde and undecanyl cetanoate was also reported (Paliwal et al., 1991). The ethanolic extract of the root was devoid of flavonoids. It however, had saponins which on acid hydrolysis yielded steroidal sapogenin. No asparagine could be isolated (Subramanian and Nair, 1968a). The alkaloids and tannins were found to be absent. The root contained proteins, saponins, carbohydrates, crude fibre, inorganic matter and mucilage. The mucilage was found to contain glucose and galacturonic acid in the ratio of 3:2. In addition, uronic acid constituted 39.2 per cent of the mucilage besides hemicelluloses and insoluble polysaccharides. The ethanolic extract of the root yielded D- glucose, D-mannose and a new disaccharide which was assigned the structure of 3- I11OI11 âÃ-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannopyranose. The analysis of the hemicellulose of the tubers gave two fractiona AB112B11 and BB112B11. Both the fractions constituted from the same sugar and uronic acid, namely glucose and galacturonic acid but in different proportions. In hemicellulose AB112B11 the molecular ratio of these compounds was 10:1 while in BB112B11 it was 5:2. Under the controlled conditions of hydrolysis both the fractions gave rise to glucose and a gluco-galacturonic acid.

In view of its prevalent uses, it has been very extensively investigated for its biological activities in experimental models as well as clinical settings. Neem oil (0.55 cc) and its two bitter principles nimbidin (5.0 mg) and nimbidol (5.0 mg) did not exhibit any estrogenic activity in ovariectomised rats. Neem oil possessed mild antiovulatory activity (25.0 per cent, 37.5 per cent and 40.0 per cent, in doses of 2, 4 and 6 ml/kg bw orally, respectively) in rabbits, when given for 3d prior to inducing ovulation. Single or multiple post coital intravaginal application of neem oil (75 and 25Âµl) on 2-4 and 4-6 d of pregnancy during pre-, peri- and post-implantation periods could completely prevent implantation in rats. In another study, neem oil was found to have antiimplantation/abortifacient effect in rats and rabbits when applied intravaginally on day 2 to day 7 pf expected pregnancy. Neem oil (1 ml) extracted from the seeds, when administered deep into vagina in Rhesus monkeys using a tuberculin syringe showed that the oil on vagina application acted both as pre-coital as well as post-coital contraceptive agent. Subcutaneous administration of neem oil (0.05 to 0.30 ml/rat/day for 5 or 7d after coitus showed significant antifertility activity. Subcutaneous administration of ethanolic extract of the seeds (0.1ml/day/rat) for 6, 12 and 18 d caused significant decrease in the glycogen content of liver and kidneys and increase in adrenals. Protein contents were also increased in adrenals and decreased in kidneys. All biochemical parameters remained unchanged in spleen. Histological features of these organs were also changed. The kidneys showed severe damage which included disorganization of cortical and tubular cells and there was no differentiation of cortical and tubular regions. The ethanolic extract of the seeds when tested for its toxicity in reproductive organs of adult cyclic rats at a dose of 0.1 ml/rat, s.c. for three different durations of 6, 12 and 18d as compared to control rats receiving olive oil as vehicle, caused degenerative changes in the ovarian follicles and thickening of the cells of granulosa. A polyherbal preparation âpraneenâ containing the purified extract of neem, quinine, hydrochloride and saponins extracted from a pericarp of I11Sapindus mukerossiI11 used in either in liquid form or as cream, on intravaginal application was found to be effective in preventing pregnancy in rabbits and also in post coital tests in Bonnet monkeys and baboons. Acute and sub-acute toxicity studies revealed the safety of the preparation and lack of side effects in both rodents and monkeys. The shelf life of the cream at room temperature was estimated to be 18 months by accelerated stability studies. The product had spermicidal activity. In an in vitro study the spermicidal activity of sodium nimbidinate using sperm suspension prepared from the epididymis of rats and human semen revealed that 2.5 mg per cent of sodium nimbidinate killed all the rat sperms in 30 min. Freshly prepared water extract as well as decoction of crushed green leaves (1 ml) orally fed to mice daily for one month showed a reversible antifertility activity without inhibition of spermatogenesis. Mating with the extract-treated mice reduced the number of pregnancies as well as the litter size. However, after one and a half month of the drug-free interval, the male mice showed a normal reproductive function as indicated by the number of pregnancies. Indigenously available neem oil in its natural form tested for its spermicidal activity ( in vitro and in vivo) showed that the undiluted oil possessed strong spermicidal action (within 30 sec) against Rhesus monkey and human spermatozoa in vitro. Neem oil in doses of 2,4 and 6 ml/kg bw fed orally for one month showed remarkable loss of reproductive functions in rats and rabbits without interfering with spermatogenesis. The ethanolic extract of the leaves in oral dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 21d in male rats though did not interfere with spermatogenesis but antiimplantational and abortifacient effects were observed in females mated by these males. An alternate approach to vasectomy for long term male contraception involving a single intravas application of neem oil (50Âµl) was studied in male rats and results compared with control animals receiving peanut oil. Animals put on continuous mating 4 wk after the treatment with females of proven fertility revealed ability throughout the 8 months of observation period. Nimbidin, isolated from oil, had a potent hypoglycaemic activity in fasting and glucose-fed rabbits. The aqueous extract of the leaves administered i.v. at a dose of 0.15 ml/kg had appreciable effect on blood glucose levels in dogs. The oil in 2.5 ml and nimbidin in 200 mg/kg bw doses exhibited significant hypoglycaemic activity by reducing the blood sugar level by 24 and 26 per cent, respectively at the 5th of h of feeding. The tender leaf decoction failed to show any significant effect at all the 5th h of feeding. The tender leaf decoction failed to show any significant effect at all the three dose levels studied. Neem oil was investigated for possible hypoglycaemic activity on normal fasting rabbits; hyperglycaemic rabbits following oral glucose meal; hyperglycaemic rats following i.p. injection of adrenaline and alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. The results indicated that the after oral administration of 2 ml/kg bw of neem oil. The fall of blood sugar persisted for 8 h and level of blood sugar returned to normal after 24h. On chronic administration for 21d (once a day) the blood sugar fell by 24.13 per cent. Sodium nimbidinate obtained from the seed oil was found to be a potent diuretic agent in dogs. The ethanolic extracts of the leaves and seeds showed in vitro antimalarial activity against chloroquine-sensitive and resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Neem seed extracts as well as its various purified fractions extracted with solvents of different polarity PNE, ENM (rich in relatively polar components) and ENS (non-polar components) showed in vitro antiplasmodial activity against Plasmodium falciparum. The aqueous suspension (100 mg/kg) of the leaves influenced several biochemical, immunological and visceral parameters in normal and stressed rats. It lowered the blood glucose, triglyceride and SGOT levels in normal rats, and attenuated stress-induced elevations of cholesterol and urea levels. Modulation of humoral and cell-mediated immune response by leaves extract was seen in ovalbumin-immunized mice when fed for 3 wk orally. Nimbidiol in a dose of 50 mg/kg in yeast-induced pyrexia in rats, caused immediate reduction in temperature. Nimbidol was also found to be more potent than nimbidin at a dose of 25 mg/100g bw given orally twice a day for 4d in suppressing the infection of I11Plasmodium gallinaceumI11 in chicks. Two different fractions of leaves, DM (dried material) and FPM (filter paper material) suspended in propylene glycol showed reduction in the spontaneous activity, respiratory rate, piloerection, diuresis and hypothermia after oral administration in mice. The cardio-depressant effect of neem leaf extract on isolated frog and rabbitâs heart was not blocked by atropine or mefgramine. Hydroalcoholic neem leaf extract caused a dose âdependent hypotensive effect in frog heart. The triterpenoid 24-methylenecycloartanol showed antiproteolytic activity in vitro as demonstrated by inhibition of trypsin-induced hydrolysis of bovine serum, albumin and casein. Neem oil, nimbidin and nimbidol exhibited a non specific spasmolytic activity on the contractions induced by histamine and acetylcholine on guinea pig ileum. Aqueous liquid extract of fruits in kaolin and pectin in the form of suspension revealed antidiarrhoeal activity against castor oil-induced diarrhoea in rats. The oil obtained from the various parts of neem tree i.e. leaves, bark and seeds, possessed wide antibacterial spectrum against gram positive and gram negative organisms viz., I11Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella pestis, Bacillus typhosum, Bac paratyphosumI11 A and B, I11Bac FriedlanderI11 and I11Vibrio cholerae.I11 The essential oil obtained from the leaves particularly possessed marked antibacterial activity against streptomycin-resistant strain of I11Mycobacterium tuberculosisI11 (human, avian and bovine types) as compared to the oils of obtained from the bark and seeds. Two hundred clinical isolates of bacteria, subjected to in vitro antibacterial effects of neem oil ( procured from Khadi and Village Industries Commission, Pune), showed 92 per cent susceptibility, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) varying between 1/4 to 1/64 dilution. The oil has significant antibacterial properties against pathogenic gram negative bacilli such as I11Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp.I11 and I11Klebsiella aerogenesI11 and against gram positive cocci such as I11Staphylococcus pyogenes.I11 The essential oil of the seeds showed in vitro inhibition against pathogenic bacteria I11Bacillus anthracis, Bac mycoides, Bac pumilus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas mangiferae indicae, Sarcina lutea, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph albusI11 and I11Xanthomonas campestris.I11 In in vitro studies the extract of the flowers showed antibacterial activity against some plant and human pathogenic bacteria. The extract showed varing range of inhibition against I11Xanthomonas campestris I11 (-), I11Pseudomonas mangiferae indicaeI11 (-), I11Bacillus subtilisI11 (-),I11Bac pumilusI11 (+), I11Staphylococcus albusI11 (+) and I11Vibrio choleraeI11 (+). Neem oil and its various constituents on screening for antifungal activity against a number of fungi using different techniques showed promising results. The essential oil of the seeds possessed in vitro antifungal activity against the dermatophytic fungi I11Microsporum gypseumI11 and I11Trichophyton rubrumI11 while it was less active against I11Malbranchea pulchella, Gymnoascus reesaiiI11 and I11Aspergillus fumigatus.I11 The oil had fungicidal activity against keratinophillic fungi I11Microsporum gypseum, Chrysosporium tropicum, Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium liliacinum, Fusarium nivale, Malbranchea pulchellaI11 and I11Gymnoascus reesaii.I11 The leaf extract was also found active against the dermatophytic fungi I11Paecilomyces lilacinus, Microsporum gypseumI11 and I11Pseudogymnoascus roseus.I11 The leaf extract tested for its in vitro effect on the mycelial growth of 2 strains (HB111B11 and HB112B11) of Scytalidium anamorph of Hendersonula toruloidea causing skin and nail disease in man, showed only 3.17 per cent inhibition against the HB112B11 strain, while no activity against the HB111B11 strain, while no activity against the H1 strain. The extract of the leaves showed strong toxicity against the ringworm fungi I11Epidermophyton floccosumI11 (60.47 per cent) and I11Trichophyton mentagrophytesI11 (53.44 per cent), while poor activity against I11Microsporum gypseum.I11 Neem cake amended soil significantly reduced the incidence of black scurf on potatoes, reduced the wilt incidence in pigeon pea, Thanjavur wilt of coconut; muskmelon wilt caused by I11Fusarium solani.I11 The extract of the leaves inhibited the growth of the spores and sclerotial production of the fungal pathogens of rice viz., I11Corticium sasakiiI11 and I11Pyricularia oryzaeI11 while it had no activity against I11Drechslera oryzae.I11 Neem, as a green manure, prolonged the sclerotial viability over control of I11Corticium sasakiiI11. The ethanolic extract of the leaves (1000 ppm) completely inhibited the conidial and mycelial growth of I11Rhizoctonia solaniI11 and I11Fusarium moniliformeI11 in addition to I11Pyricularia oryzae.I11 The aqueous extract of the leaves was effective against the fungal pathogens I11Botryodiplodia theobromae, Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium speciferum, Curvuluria lunata, Aspergillus flavusI11 and I11Trichothecium roseumI11 causing banana rot and I11Pestalotiopsis mangiferaeI11 causing leaf spot of I11Mangifera indica.I11 The extract also inhibited the mycelial growth of weeds fungi I11Myceliophthora leuta, Papulaspora lyssina. Chaetomium globosumI11 and I11Trichoderma virideI11 in vitro causing considerable loss to mushrooms. The aqueous extracts of leaf, trunk bark, fruit pulp as well as the oil of the seeds revealed fungicidal effect on soil borne pathogens I11Fusarium oxysporumI11f. sp. ciceri, I11Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotium rolfsiiI11 and I11Sclerotina sclerotorumI11 causing wilt and rot of gram (I11Cicer arietinumI11) grown on liquid medium. The seedling extract inhibited the spore germination of I11Botrytis cinereI11a and I11Colletotrichum gloeoesporioides.I11 The 10 per cent water extract of the tender leaves inhibited the plaque formation of vaccinia virus in tissue culture by two logs and pock formation on chorioallantoic membrane by four logs. The crude extract of the leaves was found to be potent in reducing the infectivity of potato virus X, bean common mosaic virus infecting various legumes and pulses, urd bean leaf crinkle virus and spinach mosaic virus. The leaf and the bark extracts inhibited the cowpea mosaic comovirus. Neem tree has emerged as a single most important source of insecticides. All parts of the tree are biologically active. The tree has shown diverse biological effects against insects. Today numerous studies are available describing the insecticidal, repellent, feeding and oviposition deterrent, antihormonal, growth regulatory and sterilant effects of the tree. These biological activities have been demonstrated for the oil expelled from seeds and leaves; leaf, fruit and seed extracts; neem cake and various other isolates. These materials have been tested against household pests of medical and hygienic importance. The bitter fixed oil, amorphous bitter principles and crystalline substances attribute to the insecticidal activity of the tree. Neem oil applications revealed good acaricidal activity in sarcoptic mange in sheep. Pure neem oil obtained from the seed kernels and neem ointment (neem oil in paraffin base 50:50) evaluated in experimentally created incised and gap wounds in bovine calves showed an initial mild irritant effect followed by an anodyne and astringent effect on wounds. The wounds neither suppurated nor miasmated and healed by granulation. C11Clinical studiesC11 Polyherbal preparation âpraneemâ, containing purified extracts of neem, quinine hydrochloride and saponins extracted from the pericarp of Sapindus mukerossi was used as a cream or pessary in Phase I clinical trials at the Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi in patients with abnormal discharge due to genital infections. The subjects applied 5 ml of the cream every night for 7- 14d. The cream was highly effective in patients with Chlamydia trachomatis. Patients with vaginitis due to Candida albicans were also benefited clinically in the trial. In addition, it showed antimicrobial action on Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans and Gardenerella vaginalis amongst the vaginal pathogens in in vitro studies. The formulation was also claimed to be effective in the treatment of human papillomas virus-16 infection in female genital tract. In a limited preliminary clinical trial, oral administration of 5 g of aqueous leaf paste or equivalent amount of dried leaf in a capsule enabled diabetic patients to reduce their dosage of insulin up to 30-50 per cent without significant effect on the blood glucose levels. Of the 9 patients of congestive cardiac failure with anasarca, examined for the diuretic effect on sodium nimbidinate (250 mg administered daily for 2-13d with an average of about 5 injections per patient) eight showed a definite diuretic response as compared to the four controls who were on bed rest, low sodium diet and adequate digitalization without any diuretic. The clinical efficacy of neem leaves in the form of a lotion, was studied in common skin disorders in 19 randomly selected cases of the age group of 25-35 years. The lotion was applied twice daily. In acute eczema cases (3), new skin formation took place within 5-10d of treatment. In cases with acute on chronic eczema (3), the response was slow and one case had a relapse after 30-40d of treatment.

This indicated the possibility of these substances being secondary products formed during storage of the seed or the expressed oil. Studies on structure elucidation of nimbin were carried out by different groups of workers. Nimbin was found to be triterpenoid derivable from apoeuphol with one of the rings (ring C) broken. The other constituents isolated from the seed oil were nimbinin; vepinine, gedunin and desacetylgedunin; the protomeliacin meliantriol; salannolide; 4-epinimbin, nimbin, desacetylnimbin and salannin; 17-epinimbocinol, nimbocinol. The detailed chemical, analytical and spectral studies on nimbin group of constituents in the tree have been carried out.. Seed/ Fruits The seed kernel extracts has resulted in the isolation of several azadirachtins and their analogues. While a lot of work has been done outside India by foreign workers, we report here the work done by Indian workers on azadirachtins (A, B, D, H, I and K). The extract on preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) without conventional chromatography yielded the known azadirachtins viz., azadirachtin A, azadirachtin B and azadirachtin D; azadirachtin H and 11Ã-H epimer; azadirachtin I and azadirachtin K. Besides these, azadirachtin related compounds viz., 13, 14-desepoxyazadirachtin A, 1-epiazadirachtin H; 3S224-acetoxy-1S224-hydroxyazadirachtol and 11S224-hydroxy-12-norazadirachtin were also identified from the seeds. The seeds in addition yielded the limonoids identified as 11-hydroxyvilasinin and 23-desmethyllmocin-B. Azadirachtin A was obtained in crystalline state and its crystal and molecular structure was determined using X-ray diffraction techniques. A study on the stereochemistry of azadirachtins H and I suggested that the structures of the two should be revised. 11S224-H and 11Ã-H epimers of azadirachtin H were reviewed. Preparative HPLC procedure has been devised for isolation of azadirachtins and other triterpenoids from seed kernels. Using this optimized method, the azadirachtin content of the seed kernels of neem fruits collected from nine agro-climatic zones of Rajasthan and eight agro-climatic zones of Gujarat were determined. The azadirachtin content varied from 0.194 per cent to 0.670 per cent in the former by weight of the seed kernel. A simple analytical method using optimum HPLC conditions and various solvents as extracting medium was established for the estimation of neem bitters (azadirachtin and nimbidin) in the neem seed kernels. The maximum amount of nimbidin was found in the neem bitters precipitated out when water was used as extracting medium whereas, the percentage of azadirachtin was maximum when extracted with 90 per cent ethanol in water (Akhila and Srivastava, 1998). The feasibility of using a triple solvent systems comprising, acetonitrile, methanol and water in the quantification of azadirachtin in the neem based pesticides has been studied. Radioactive azadirachtin, nimbin and salannin were also produced using P1114P11C-mevalonate and acetate as precursors under in vivo and in vitro conditions in the seed kernels. The tetranortriterpenoids identified in the seeds/kernel were desacetylnimbin; nimbidinin and nimbidic acid; nimbolide, ohcinolide B, 6-deacetylnimbin, azadiradione, nimbin, salannin; nimbanal and 3-acetyl derivative of salannol. It has been reported that photooxidation of nimbin results in its conversion to nimbinolide and isonimbinolide. The seed oil contained azadirone, azadiradione and epoxyazadiradione besides gedunin. The tetranortriterpenoids isolated from the ethanolic extract of the fresh green leaves were identified as meldenin diol, vilasinin, nimonol and isomeldenin; while the fallen yellow leaves gave meldenin and isomeldenin. Quercetin was obtained as an aglycone from the glycosides of the leaves (green/yellow). The structure of nimonol was assigned to nimocinol, the tetranortriterpenoid isolated from the fruits. Later, the structure of nimonol was reassigned on detailed studies. While 6-acetylnimonol was found to be identical with 6-acetoxyazadirone, dihydronimonol was identified as isomeldenin. The biosynthetic relationship of the two limonoids nimocinol and nimocinolide present in the winter leaves was studied under in vivo conditions. The hexane extract of the fresh leaves contained S224-linolenic acid. Optimised procedures for the isolation of limonoids nimbolide and 28-deoxonimbolide, the major antifeedant compounds against the pests of black pepper (Longitarsus nigripennis) and cashew (Heliopeltis antonii), respectively, were developed. About 100 compounds, mostly triterpenoids of protolimonoids (protomeliacins), limonoids (OR meliacins OR tetranortriterpenoids), tetranortriterpenoid-S226-hydroxy butenolides, pentanortriterpenoids, a hexanortriterpenoid apart from a few nontriterpenoid constituents have been reported from various parts as detailed below.

Flowers The petroleum ether extract of dry flowers gave a waxy solid substance and an oil having bitter taste comprising of saturated acids. The ethanolic extract was reported to have bitter toxic substances (Subramanian and Rangaswamy, 1947). Mitra et al. (1947) examined the ethanolic extract of the dry blossoms of neem and isolated a crystalline compound, nimbosterol; a glycoside nimbosterin; a flavon nimbicetin; a hydrocarbon nonacosane; a highly pungent essential oil; a sesquiterpene and a fatty acid fraction containing palmitic, oleic and smaller amounts of stearic, linoleic, behenic and arachidic acids. Nimbicetin was later identified as tetrahydroxyflavone identical with kaempferol (Mitra, 1951). The flowers in addition yielded three flavonoids viz., myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol (Pankajamani and Seshadri, 1952). On examination of the ethanolic extract of the blossoms from Delhi area, Mitra and Siddiqui (1948) could not obtain any bitter principle but obtained the earlier isolated compounds nimbicetin, nimbosterol and nonacosane. A myricetin glycoside, designated as melictrin was isolated from the ethanol extract of the flowers along with quercetin-3-galactoside and kaempferol-3-glucoside. Melicitrin was characterized as myrectin-3â-L-arabinoside and formed the first report of isolation of a myricetin pentoside (Subramanian and Nair, 1972). Further a new tetranortriterpenoid neeflone was isolated from the flowers whose structure was established as 15-acetoxy-7-deactoxydihhdoazadirone (Nanduri and Banstola, 1995). An essential oil (0.25 per cent) obtained from the flowers was found to contain thio-amyl alcohol (7.6 per cent), benzyl alcohol (9.67 per cent), benzyl acetate (8.2 per cent), an unidentified alcohol (3.9 per cent), sesquiterpenes viz., azadirachtene, margosene, and a hydrocarbon (Nigam, 1963). A new isoprenylated flavanone nimbaflavone characterized as 8, 3â-diisoprenyl-5, 7-dihyroxy-4âmethoxyflavanone and a new meliacin 2â, 3â-dehydrosalannol related to salannin were isolated from the leaves in addition to the known meliacins nimbolide, 3-desacetylsalannin and Ã-sitosterol and its Ã-D-glucoside. This was the first report on occurrence of an isoprenyl flavanone in the Meliaceae family which strengthens the taxonomic closeness of Meliaceae with Rutacea (Garg and Bhakuni, 1984b, 1985). Further, the limonoids, azadirachtin A was isolated from the leaves (Podder and Mahato, 1985). Neem oil There have been a number of investigations of neem oil which have been of a conflicting nature both with respect to the active principles as well as the component fatty acids of the fixed glycerides. The so called margosic acid claimed by Chatterjee (1919) and Chatterjee and Sen (1920) was subsequently shown by a number of workers to be a mixture of common fatty acids viz., oleic, stearic, palmitic, linoleic, arachidic and lignoceric acids (Roy and Dutt, 1929; Child and Ramanathan, 1936; Hildich and Murti, 1939; Child and Nathanael, 1944). The oil also had some unsaturated resinous acid along with bitter resinous impurities (Roy and Dutt, 1929).", "uses": [{"disease": "Body ache", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Fever", "part_used": "Stem/Bark"}, {"disease": "Foot cracks", "part_used": "Stem/Bark"}, {"disease": "Head ache", "part_used": "Stem/Bark"}, {"disease": "Poison bite", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Skin diseases", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Toothache", "part_used": "Stem/Bark"}, {"disease": "Wounds", "part_used": "Leaves"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/65/1/65.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/65/2/65.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Azadirachta indica</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Azadirachta indica </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Indian lilac (English) ,Margosa (English) ,Neem (English) ,Nim (Hindi) ,Nimb (Hindi) ,Ninb (Hindi) ,Arishta (Sanskrit) ,Arkapadapa (Sanskrit) ,Chhardana (Sanskrit) ,Chhardighna (Sanskrit) ,Hingu (Sanskrit) ,Hinguniryasa (Sanskrit) ,Hingushivaatika (Sanskrit) ,Kaitarya (Sanskrit) ,Kakaphala (Sanskrit) ,Kireshta (Sanskrit) ,Kitaka (Sanskrit) ,Malaka (Sanskrit) ,Neta (Sanskrit) ,Nimba (Sanskrit) ,Nimbah (Sanskrit) ,Nimbaka (Sanskrit) ,Nimbavrikshaha (Sanskrit) ,Niryasa (Sanskrit) ,Niyamana (Sanskrit) ,Pakvakrita (Sanskrit) ,Paribhadhraka (Sanskrit) ,Paribhadrakah (Sanskrit) ,Pichumanda (Sanskrit) ,Picumanda (Sanskrit) ,Picumandah (Sanskrit) ,Picumarda (Sanskrit) ,Pitasara (Sanskrit) ,Prabhadra (Sanskrit) ,Prabhadrah (Sanskrit) ,Pukamalaka (Sanskrit) ,Puyari (Sanskrit) ,Rajabhadraka (Sanskrit) ,Ravipriya (Sanskrit) ,Sarvatobhadra (Sanskrit) ,Shirshaparna (Sanskrit) ,Shita (Sanskrit) ,Shukrapriya (Sanskrit) ,Subhadra (Sanskrit) ,Sumana (Sanskrit) ,Varatvacha (Sanskrit) ,Vishirnaparna (Sanskrit) ,Vranasodhakari (Sa</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>A.

It has been used in epilepsy, insanity, as a nervine tonic, memory enhancer, for intellectual enhancement etc. Therefore, it has been investigated in detail with special reference to psychoneuropharmacology, and the possible biochemical mechanism of action was elucidated. Some clinical trials were conducted. Some Neuropharmacological actions of hersaponin isolated from the plant were investigated. It had primarily a sedative action in mice. It did not protect rats against electroshock and mice against metrazol seizures. Alcoholic extract of âbrahmiâ in a dose of 25 mg/kg produced slight reduction in the spontaneous motility in mice while 50 to 100 mg/kg i.p. in dose exerted sedative effects in albino rats and rabbits. The behavioural effects of the plant suggested that it had tranquilizing properties but was much weaker than chlorpromazine. It could not block the conditioned avoidance response (CAR) in rats significantly even at higher doses but markedly potentiated chlorpromazine effect on CAR. When given in combination with reserpine, the effect was found to be approximately the sum of their independent effects. Further studies revealed that it decreased motivation for food in hungry rats but did not affect the visual discriminative capacity in rats. It exhibited signs of neurological deficit at 20 mg/kg. The plant extract reduced the spontaneous motor activity (SMA) in non stimulated in rats like other tranquilizers but was less effective than chlorpromazine in antagonising the SMA of amphetamine stimulated rats. It produced graded hypothermia in mice. Effect of the plant extract was studied on conditioned learning of rats, employing T maze. It was observed that oral administration of aqueous decoction of âbrahmiâ exerted a significant improvement in conditioned learning of these animals. Bacosine isolated from aerial parts (dose 25 mg/kg i.p.) exhibited moderate analgesic effects. Brahmi extract in a dose of 100 mg/ml showed barbiturate hypnosis potentiating effect with improved learning behaviour in albino rats. Effects of total extract, alkaloidal fraction and hersaponin isolated from plant on the respiratory activity in vitro of rat brain was studied. The total extract and alkaloidal fraction inhibited the respiration of rat brain tissue to a varying degree. The effect of ethanolic extract of the plant on the cerebral amino acid, S226-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and glutamine of albino rats was studied at different time intervals with a dose of 100 mg/kg bw. The extract increased GABA level profoundly 15 min after administration, suggesting a correlation between the sedative property of âbrahmiâ and the increased GABA level of cerebral tissues. âBrahmiâ was studied experimentally for its antianxiety effects in rats. The total extract of âbrahmiâ in a dose of 50 mg/100 g bw (50 mg dry extract) orally and its water soluble and insoluble fractions (equivalent to the dose of its total extract) did not show any significant effect on the activity of normal rats. The water insoluble portion showed a significant barbiturate hypnosis potentiation effect. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of the plant was reported to exhibit anticancer activity against Walker carcinosarcoma 256 in rat which was confirmed in the fractionated extract. The crude alcoholic extract of the plant was reported to have cardiotonic and vasoconstrictor actions in frogs and sedative and neuromuscular blocking actions both in frogs and rats. A glycoside saponin isolated was found to have cardiotonic action in normal and hypodynamic frogâs heart, sedative action in rats and guinea pigs, spasmodic action on smooth muscle of rabbit, guinea pigâs ileum and ratâs uterus. The total alkaloidal fraction of the plant stimulated autonomic ganglia followed by blockade, produced spasm of the skeletal muscle acting through neuromuscular junctional apparatus, stimulated respiration followed by depression, showed phenomenon of tachyphylaxis and produced rigidity and convulsions in mice. The alcoholic extract of the plant (50mg/kg i.p.) showed tranquilizing effect in rats and dogs. The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stem and leaves did not show antibacterial activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stem and leaves did not show anthelmintic activity when tested against earthworms in I11in vitroI11 studies. C11Clinical StudiesC11 A clinical study was undertaken with crude aqueous and defatted alcoholic extracts of the plant in 24 patients with varied mental disorders. The study revealed improvement in learning process and correction in the abnormal behaviour of epileptic patients treated with defatted alcoholic extract (2-4 mg/kg bw) and crude aqueous extract of âbrahmiâ 2 ozs daily for 5 months. 35 cases of anxiety neurosis were treated with âbrahmiâ. One month of treatment of âbrahmiâ in the dose of 30 ml per day in two divided doses (representing 12 g of the dry crude drug) provided significant relief in symptoms besides a quantitative reduction in the level of anxiety. Efficacy of plant was studied in revitalizing intellectual functions in forty school going children from rural area in Varanasi.

Bacoside A on acid hydrolysis gave three mononsaccharides, two of which were identified as glucose and arabinose. Bacoside B also gave glucose and arabinose on hydrolysis. Presence of stigmasterol was also confirmed by. Bacosides A and B were identified in terms of their carbohydrate and aglycone moieties. Bacoside A on acid hydrolysis gave rise to four crystalline bacogenins AB111B11, A B112B11, AB113B11, AB114B11. On the basis of correlation studies with structure of bacogenin A1, the structure of bacoside A was proposed as 3-(S224-L-arabinopyranosyl-I11OI11 âÃ-D-glucopyranosid-10,20-dihydroxy-16-keto-dammarene-(24). Bacoside B on hydrolysis gave glucose, arabinose and the same bacogenins as above and hence bacoside B was assigned the same gross structure as proposed for bacoside A. The two bacosides were optical isomers in which bacoside B was found to be dextrorotatory and bacoside A laevorotatory. The haemolytic action of bacoside B was twice that of bacoside A, due to the differences in the configuration of the carbohydrate chain. Three new triterpene saponins bacoside AB111B11, bacoside AB112B11 and bacoside AB113B11 were isolated in minor quantities from the mixture of saponins obtained from the plant. These were assigned structures as 3-I11OI11 â[S224-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->3)-S224-arabinopyranosyl] jujubogenin, 3Ã-[I11OI11 -S224 âL-arabinofuranosyl (1-->6)-I11OI11 â[-S224-arabinopyranosyl (1-->5)]-I11OI11 â(S224-D-glucofuranosyl)oxy] pseudojujubogenin and 3-Ã-[I11OI11 âÃ-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3)-I11OI11 â[S224-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->2)]-I11OI11 â(Ã-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy] jujubogenin, respectively. The I11cisI11-isomer of ebelin lactone was also obtained as one of the artifacts of the aglycone and its structure was revised (Jain and Kulshrestha, 1993). Preliminary chemical studies on the plant showed absence of alkaloids, steroids and amino acids (Shukla, 1983). In another study, the plant showed presence of steroids/terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and saponins and absence of phenolics. In yet another preliminary Phytochemical study, presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, sterols and absence of glycosides and terpenoids were reported in the plant. The aerial parts yielded a new triterpene named as bacosine which was characterized as lup-20(29)-ene-3S224-ol-27-oic acid (Vohra et al., 1997). A new sterol, 13,14-seco-stigma 9(11), 14(15) diene-3Ã-ol, designated as bacosterol was also reported from the aerial parts. Isolation of alkaloids, brahmine and herpestine was reported from the leaves. A mixture of three alkaloids, BB111B11, BB112B11 and BB113B11 was previously obtained from the leaves but these could only be isolated as salts. The fresh samples of leaves did not contain appreciable quantities of the bases, BB112B11 and BB113B11 .A previously underscribed sterol was obtained along with the alkaloids. Four new dammarane type triterpene saponins, bacopasaponins A, B, C and D were isolated from leaves and identified as 3-I11OI11 âS224-L-arabinopyranosyl-20-I11OI11 âS224-L-arabinopyranosyl-jujubogenin, 3-I11OI11 â[S224-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->2) S224-L-arabinopyranosyl] pseudojujubogenin, 3-I11OI11 â[Ã-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3) {S224-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->2) S224-L-arabinopyranosyl] pseudojujubogenin and 3-I11OI11 â[S224-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->2) Ã-D-glucopyranosyl] pseudojujubogenin respectively (Garai et al., 1996a, 1996b).The leaves were reported to yield further two or more dammarane-type jujubogenin bisdesmosides, bacopasaponins E and F which were characterized as 3-I11OI11 â[Ã-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3) {S224-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->2)}S224- L-arabinopyranosyl] 20-I11OI11 âS224-L-arabinopyranosyl jujubogenin and 3-I11OI11 â[Ã-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->3) {S224-L-arabinofuranosyl (1-->2) Ã-D-glucopyranosyl]-20-I11OI11 â(S224-L-arabinopyranosyl jujubogenin, respectively (Mahato et al., 2000).", "uses": [{"disease": "Breathlessness", "part_used": "Leaves"}, {"disease": "Hair growth", "part_used": "Whole Plant"}, {"disease": "Tonic", "part_used": "Whole Plant"}], "images": ["https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/67/1/67.jpg", "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/assets/img/PlantImage/67/2/67.jpg"], "raw_html_snippet": "<div class=\"container\">\n<h4>You have searched for: Bacopa monneria</h4>\n<table class=\"table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b><h4 style=\"color:#5B2C6F\">Plant Name:</h4> </b> <h2 style=\"color:#FF5733\">Bacopa monneria </h2></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\" class=\"danger\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Plant Details</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"justify\" colspan=\"8\"><b>Vernacular Name - Language</b> : Brahmi (English) ,Barami (Hindi) ,Jalanim (Hindi) ,Braahmi (Sanskrit) ,Nir-Brahmi (Sanskrit) ,Saraswati (Sanskrit) ,Jalabrahmi (Kannada) ,Nirbrahmi (Kannada) ,Brahmi (Malayalam) ,Nibrahmi (Malayalam) ,Nirpirami (Tamil) ,Piramiyapundu (Tamil) </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Synonym(s)</b> : Not Available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"8\"><b>Author : </b>L.

It is widely used in jaundice, hepatitis, oedema, oligurea, anaemia inflammations, eye diseases, etc. Pharmacologists and clinicians have investigated âpunarnavaâ for all these activities. In some cases, the findings support the existing clinical uses. Different extracts and three isolated from extracts were subjected to in vivo and in vitro testing for antihepatotoxic activity. The petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts and the total alkaloids (isolated from the methanolic extract) of the root were reported to slightly lower the increased SGOPT, SGPT, SALP in rats treated with CCI4. The chloroform and the methanol extracts exhibiting relatively better enzyme lowering effects were subjected to further fractionation yielding one of the isolates identified as rotenoid (6, 11-dihydroxy-9-10-dimethyl-4-methoxyrotenoid. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of root (100 mg/100 g bw) protected the albino rats from hepatotoxic action against country made liquor (CML) - induced hepatotoxicity. An alcoholic extract of the plant given orally exhibited hepatoprotective against experimentally induced CCIB114B11 â hepatotoxicity in rats and mice. Administration of aqueous form of drug (2 ml/kg) had more hepatoprotective activity than the powder form. This was probably due to the better absorption of the liquid form through the intestinal tract. The effect of extracts of red and white varieties of the plant was studied on diuresis and renal enzymes. Both the varieties exhibited diuretic activity in toads. Red variety showed comparatively less activity. The diuretic activity of water soluble fraction of root and leaves was reported in male albino rats and dogs. The activity was attributed to the presence of potassium content in it. The aqueous and acetone extracts of the root, showed significant antiinflammatory activity against carrageenan-induced oedema and formaldehyde-induced arthritis in albino rats. The water insoluble alcoholic extract of different parts of the plant viz., root, stem, leaves and flowers and plant was studied for antiinflammatory activity against carrageenan-induced oedema in rats and for diuretic activity. The root and leaves were found to be most active and the activity was found maximum during rainy season. The alkaloidal fraction isolated from the root was investigated for its effect on plasma cortisol, adrenal, cortisol and humoral response in stressed rats. It exhibited restorative activity against stress-induced changes in plasma and adrenal cortisol levels. It also significantly augmented the antibody production in stressed rats as compared to control. The 50 per cent aqueous ethanolic extract of root, when administered orally in experimental monkeys was found to stop intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD)-induced bleeding at 50mg/kg bw. Presence of cholinestrase activity was shown in leaves while the activity was not detected in stem/branch. The punarnavine isolated from the plant produced distinct and persistent rise of blood pressure and marked diuresis in cats when injected intravenously. The total alcoholic extract, its water soluble and water insoluble fractions and fat soluble fraction from petroleum ether extract showed a cardiotonic effect, an increase in blood pressure in dog and relaxant effect on smooth muscle of rabbit. In a general pharmacological screening, the 50 per cent alcoholic extract of the root exhibited significant antiinflammatory activity in both in carrageenan oedema and cotton pellet implantation models and diuretic activity in albino rats. It also showed spasmogenic action on isolated guinea pig ileum. Aqueous extracts of powdered stem and root were found to be ineffective as anticoagulants against both plasma and whole blood. The plant was found to promote longevity, growth and nitrogen retention in the rats on the stock diet. The alcoholic extract of root showed antimicrobial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 whereas aqueous extract was active against I11Escherichia coliI11 and inactive against I11Staphylococcus aureus.I11 The phosphate buffer and ether extracts of shoot showed antibiotic activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus.I11 The seed exhibited antibacterial activity against I11Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas cichoriiI11and I11Salmonella typhimuriumI11 but was inactive against I11Escherichia coli.I11 The aqueous extract of root exhibited antifungal activity against I11Microsporum nanum.I11 The aqueous extract of root exhibited 21-50 per cent inhibition of spore germination against I11Curvularia lunata, Cylindrocarpon lichenicola, Fusarium solaniI11 and I11Myrothecium leucotrichum.I11 The fresh leaf extract inhibited germs tube elongation of I11Drechslera oryzae.I11 The aqueous extract of leaves/stem/ flowers/seed/plant exhibited antifungal activity against 3 keratinophilic fungi; moderate activity against I11Microsporum gypseumI11 (39.01 per cent), was less effective against I11Chrysosporium tropicumI11 (25.63 per cent) and showed minimum antimycotic activity against I11Trichophyton terrestre.I11 The aqueous extract of leaf showed nematicidal activity against second stage juveniles of I11Meloidogyne incognitaI11 (kofoid and white) chitwood. The aqueous extract of root was reported to contain an agent with characteristics of protein and which showed broad spectrum potent antiviral activity against tubular (tobacco mosaic virus â TMV and sunhemp rosette virus-SRV), spherical (gomphrena mosaic virus-GMV and tobacco ring spot virus-TRSV) and potato virus X in different plant host virus combinations. C11ToxicologyC11 Vomiting may be associated with large doses of the drug on account of its emetic properties. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 In a double blind clinical trial conducted on 43 normal adults, powdered whole plant in form of tablets, moderately decreased the mean level of blood urea and serum acid phosphatase. The results of a double blind trial to study the effect of âpunarnavaâ (plant) on haemoglobin, blood urea, serum cholesterol, blood sugar, vital capacity and body weight in 43 normal healthy adult volunteers in the age group 45-50 years over a period of 42 months were reported. It did not show any appreciable effect on the blood constituents in the initial examinations. Subsequent examinations have shown that it decreased blood urea and serum acid phosphatase with an increase in serum cholesterol and marginal increase in blood sugar. Weight remained almost stationery. In a trial involving 19 patients suffering from generalized anasarca, or jaundice of varying etiology, plant root extract was given orally and urine output, pulse rate and dropsy were recorded in subsequent weeks. There was increased urinary output with reduction in specific gravity of urine. In a controlled clinical trial on a total of 15 cases (including 3 cases in control group) of nephrotic syndrome, a decoction or total crude powder (10g daily in divided doses) exhibited beneficial effects comparable to corticosteroids. Out of a total of 12 cases on the decoction, 4 cases showed relief, 7 cases were improved and 1 case showed deterioration. A clinical study was carried out to evaluate the diuretic and immunological actions of âpunarnavaâ with special reference to nephrotic syndrome in 40 patients. The drug was administered to patients in the dose of 500 mg thrice a day for one month. The results showed increase in serum protein level and reduced urinary protein excretion in patients of nephrotic syndrome. In a double blind trial in children (8-12 years), it was reported that administration of milk fortified with I11Withania somniferaI11 and âpunarnavaâ daily for two months increased significantly Hb per cent and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration.

A steroid, androst-5-ene- analogue and flavone, 6, 5â-dimethoxy-5, 7, 3â-trihydroxyflavone were isolated from the aerial parts. Hentriacontane, Ã-sitosterol and ursolic acid along with glucose, fructose and sucrose were isolated from the root. The root was also reported to yield Ã-ecdysone along with triacontanol and Ã-sitosterol. A rotenoids, characterized as 6, 11-dihydroxy-9, 10-dimethyl-4-methoxyrotenoid, was isolated from the root. A new unsaturated acid, characterized as triacont-24-en-l-oic acid was also reported from the root in addition to Ã-sitosterol. Two quinolizidine alkaloids identified as punarnavine-I and punarnavine-II were isolated from root, stem and leaves. The distribution of these alkaloids was maximum in stem and minimum in root. A relation was established between the growth process of the plant and biosynthesis of these two alkaloids. The alkaloidal content was initially low during commencement of pre-reproductive phase, gradually increased in different plants parts, becoming maximum during termination phase of reproductive stage (Nandi and Chatterjee, 1974). A new C-methylflavone characterized as 5, 7-dihydroxy-3â,4â-dimethoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone was reported from root and designated as borhavone.

I11Butea MonospermaI11 (âpalasâ) is a popular drug in Ayurveda, and is prescribed in various conditions which includes worm infestations, eye diseases, antifertility activity, menstrual irregularity, etc. Antifertility activity and its mechanism have been studied in several centres. Studies have also been conducted in males. Its inflammatory activity with special reference to eye disease has been studied. The hot alcoholic extract of the seed was found effective in preventing pregnancy in all eight rats when administered at a dose of 300mg/kg bw on day 1-4 of pregnancy. At higher doses it was toxic. The same extract was shown to have antiovulatory effect when tested on rabbits. The dried alcoholic extract of seeds was reported to have distinct antifertility activity in mice and rats when given orally during the first five days of pregnancy. The antifertility activity occurred in the seed powder and its alcoholic extract but not in the aqueous or chloroform extract. The activity was of low efficacy. The extract did not have oestrogenic, antioestrogenic or androgenic actions. It partially inhibited ovulation. Various fractions of the ethanolic extract of the seeds and flowers were tested for antiimplantation activity in albino rats, at different doses. The ethanolic extract of seeds, and outer seed coat at the dose of 200 mg/kg bw in female rats exhibited 75 and 62.5 per cent antifertility activity, respectively. An aqueous extract of flowers provided protection against experimentally-induced liver injury by CClB114B11 in albino rats as evidenced by biochemical and histopathological studies. In pentobarbitone sleeping time studies, the extract showed improvement of the metabolic functions in these liver injured animals. The ocular antiinflammatory activity of the âarkasâ from the root and leaves and âarkasâ formulated as gels was studied in rabbits. The âarkasâ of the plant showed better results than the flurbiprofen, while with respect to gels, intraocular pressure monitored at different time intervals revealed no statistically significant difference between gel formulations. The water extracts of the seeds and its various fractions (FrB111B11, FrB112B11, Fr B113B11) were used for pharmacological studies. The results showed fall of blood pressure together with bronchi constriction in dogs and contraction of guinea pig ileum by water extract. FrB113B11 considerably potentiated the action of ACh on blood pressure, frog rectus and guinea pig ileum. FrB112B11 showed hypotensive action similar to that of FrB113B11 considerably potentiated the action of Ach on blood pressure. Palasonin and its piperazine salt were tested for their effect on isolated frogâs and rabbits heart, rabbitâs smooth muscles, blood pressure and respiration in dogs. Palasonin exhibited perceptible lessening of the amplitude in frogâs and rabbitâs heart. It caused slight increase in the tone of smooth muscle. It did not produce any immediate perceptible effect on blood pressure and respiration. It also exhibited partial neuromuscular blocking effect at the concentrations studied in experiments using frogâs sciatic nerve. The 50 per cent ethanolic extract of leaves, when screened for biological activities, showed spasmodic action on isolated guinea pig ileum. The alcoholic extract of the fresh bark and seeds showed antibacterial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureusI11 and I11Escherichia coli.I11 The chloroform, methanolic and aqueous extracts leaves, and a steroidal compound isolated from the leaves were screened for antimicrobial activity against I11Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilusI11 and I11Escherichia coli.I11 The methanolic extract and the steroidal compound exhibited strong activity against I11Bacillus pumilus.I11 The activity of the methanolic extract was attributed to the steroidal compound present in it. The leaf extract when screened for antifungal activity, the per cent inhibition of mycelial growth was 35.47 per cent for I11Epidermophyton floccosum,I11 40.64 per cent for I11Trichophyton mentagrophytesI11and 33.35 per cent for I11Microsporum gypseum.I11 The seeds were found to contain alkaloids, two of which were water soluble. The total alkaloids were found to be toxic to earthworms. A compound principle, isolated from the ethanolic extract of the seeds showed anthelmintic activity against roundworms. Palasonin, obtained from the seeds, and its piperazine salt were studied for in vitro anthelmintic activity against I11Ascaris lumbricoidesI11 (human) and in vivo studies against I11Toxicara canisI11in dogs. The fruit and bark were found to possess a very mild degree of insecticidal activity against houseflies, Musca domestica nebulo and Aedes aegypti. C11ToxicologyC11 Seeds contain 3 alkaloids which were toxic to earthworms. Palas exhibited low mortality in mice on acute toxicity tests. Chronic toxicity trials performed for months on rats, dogs and rabbits showed nephrotoxicity. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 Clinical trials revealed that seeds are effective in roundworm and threadworm infestations. However the clinical use of the seed as an anthelmintic drug in human is found to produce nephrotoxicity, hence not considerable safe. The seed powder was found to be effective against I11Ascaris lumbricoidesI11 in a clinical trial. A study of âpalashâ seeds used as decoction either orally or as retention enema was carried out in 15 cases of worm infestation (6 cases of roundworm, 8 cases of thread worm, and 1 case of tapeworm infestation. Five out of 6 patients of round worm, 7 out of 8 patients of thread worm showed good results whereas in the case of tapeworm no response was observed. Side effects like nausea, vomiting, dizziness, general weakness and pain in abdomen were regularly observed with oral administration, when used as retention enema, the drug caused bowel irritation.

Butein (0.003 per cent) was obtained in traces as a by product. The glycoside on acid hydrolysis gave two molecules of glucose and one molecule of butin. A bioside structure was proposed for butrin, with the sugar group occupying only one hydroxy group of butin. Later studies established that butrin was a 3â, 7-diglycoside of butin and the first example of a glycoside, amongst the anthoxanthins, to contain the sugar residues in two different positions. It was also the first instance of a compound to carry a sugar group in the side phenyl nucleus among both anthoxanthins and anthocyanins. Butrin was obtained in good yield by a simple method from the dry flowers. On acid hydrolysis, it gave a mixture of butin and butein. Two colourless, crystalline compounds were also isolated, one of which was a phytosterol and other an unidentified heteroside. Free butein and butin were also isolated from the flowers. Presence of a new chalcone glycoside isobutrin, was detected by circular chromatography along with butrin from the flowers. It was identified to be a chalcone isomer of butrin and constitution established as 4, 3â-diglycoside of butein. Isobutrin was found to be the major component of the water soluble flavonoid pigments form the flowers with an intense yellow colour. Studies showed that the flower extract could be used as a colourant in the yellow range in place of synthetic food colours. Another new glycoside palasitrin was isolated from the flowers, which yielded two molecules of glucose (at 6 and 3â position) and 2-(3, 4-dihyroxybenzylidene)-6-hydroxycoumaran-3-one on hydrolysis . A reinvestigation of the flowers revealed the presence of seven flavonoid glucosides, two of them being butrin and isobutrin isolated earlier from the plant. Three of the glucoside were identified as coreopsin, isocoreopsin and sulphurein. The remaining two new ones were named monospermoside and isomonospermoside and characterized as butein-3-Ã-D-glucoside and 3â, 4â, 7- trihydroxyflavone-3â-glucoside, respectively. Another report also showed presence of seven flavones and flavonoid constituents including butrin and isobutrin along with four amino acids (histidine, aspartic acid, alanine and Ã-alanine). ?-Sitosterol was reported from the flowers. The flower petals afforded free amino acids viz., histidine, aspartic acid, alanine, phenylalanine along with free sugars glucose and fructose. The oil from seeds showed presence of unsaturated acids (oleic and linoleic), saturated acids (palmitic and lignoceric) sitosterol and acid fractions of molecular weight 354 and 383. Further studied the seed oil for fatty acid composition. Studies showed presence of 46-47 per cent saturated acids with palmitic acid as the major component (20-23 per cent), along with smaller amounts of stearic, arachidic, behenic, lignoceric, caprylic, capric, myristic and lauric acids. The unsaturated acids consisted of oleic (26-31 per cent) and linoleic (19-28 per cent) acids. The seeds were reported to be a promising source for vegetable oil, yielding 17.5 per cent oil on air dry basis and its use in soap making was suggested. Composition of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was also reported by other workers. S224-Amyrin, Ã-sitosterol, Ã-sitosterol-Ã-D-glucoside and sucrose were reported from the seeds.

The rate of bone fracture healing was markedly hastened in animals with alcoholic free aqueous extract of the plant without affecting plasma biochemical parameters. The parental administration of total extract of the plant neutralized the antianabolic effect of cortisone in healing of fractures in rabbits. The water soluble fraction of 80% alcoholic percolate of the plant demonstrated cholinergic action in isolated ileum of rabbit and albino rat, rat uterus, dog tracheal muscle and ileum in situ and cardiotonic action in atropinised frog heart. An unidentified water soluble constituent presumably a glucoside obtained from the plant elicited dose dependent negative chronotropic effect in isolated at trial tissue of guinea pigs. The glucoside also produced dose dependent fall in blood pressure in anaesthetized cats. Diuretic activity was observed with 50 per cent ethanolic extract in mice.

The alcoholic extract showed hypotensive, antiemetic, smooth muscle relaxant and antipyretic activity. The extract also showed antimalarial activity. C11ToxicologyC11 The LDB1150B11 of petroleum ether extract of the root was 50 mg /kg and EDB1150B11 was 1.6 mg /kg intraperitoneally. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 A clinical study was made on 66 patients of peptic ulcer and 39 patients of chronic gastritis. 65 patients were treated with Shugan Jianpi decoction (a Chinese herbal preparation containing I11Cyperus rotundusI11as one of the ingredients) and 40 patients with gastropine as control group. The Chinese preparation was found more effective as compared to gastropine. It was also better in improving the function of vegetative nervous system and small intestine absorption. In a clinical trial 138 cases of intestinal metaplasia and 105 cases of a typical hyperplasia of gastric mucosa of chronic gastritis were treated with a Chinese herbal preparation, Xia Wei Yan powder, containing I11Cyperus rotundus,I11 as one of the constituents. The powder was administered orally 5-7 gm t.i.d. The results demonstrated marked therapeutic effects after 2-4 months of administration with no side effects. In a clinical trial oral administration of root powder of I11Cyperus rotundus,I11 1 gm twice daily, in 64 patients of obesity produced significant reduction in their weight. Blood pressure hypertensive obese patients were also reduced significantly, whereas there was no change in the blood pressure of normotensive patients. A clinical trial was conducted on 20 patients of oligomenorrhea to evaluate the effect of an Ayurvedic proprietary medicine, containing I11Cyperus rotundusI11 as one of the constituents. The patients were administered the drug in doses of 2tsf b.d. for a period of three months and then followed up at regular interval of one month. Four patients were reported to have conceived during the study period, indicating the usefulness of medicine in infertility and scanty menstruation. Two compound herbal preparations, consisting I11C. rotundusI11 as one of the constituents, were found effective in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery and giardiasis. A study was made to evaluate the effect of aqueous solution (2%) of the methanolic extract of root of I11C. rotundusI11 in conjunctivitis. The drug decreased the redness, pain and ocular discharge and most of the patients were cured within five days. Another clinical trial was taken on 40 patients of chronic hepatitis who were treated with a traditional Chinese decoction, containing I11Cyperus rotundusI11 as one of the Ingredients. It showed marked improvement in function of vegetative nervous system, blood viscosity and blood circulation.

C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 Clinical studies were conducted with alcoholic and aqueous extracts of I11E. ribesI11 fruits on 40 children infected by ascarides. Alcoholic extract was found effective in 80 per cent cases, while aqueous extract cured 55 percent cases, rendering stools free from ova. No toxic effects were observed during and after treatment. Fruits of I11Embelia ribes,I11 when administered in doses of 200 mg/kg to patients of worm infestation, produced good results. Marked improvement was observed in cases of tape worm, giardia and N. nana. A single dose upto a maximum of 8 gm was sufficient. Worms were expelled within 6 to 24 hours of taking the drug. The drug is well tolerated and safe for use. School children (5 -12 years) suffering from various helminth diseases were treated with Ayurvedic preparation, Kuberakshadi yoga, in a dose of 200 mg per kg body wt. in two divided dose. The drug was found effective against I11Enterobium vermicularisI11 and I11Ascaris lumbricoides.I11 Kuberakshadiyoga contained I11Caesalpinia bonducella, Embelia ribes, Ptychotis sp., Myristica fragrans, Caryophyllum aromaticumI11 and I11Cuminum cyminum.I11 In a clinical study, powder containing I11Embelia ribes, Mallotus philippinensisI11and I11Butea monospermaI11 was found effective in hymenolepiasis in children. Pippalyadi yoga, a composite drug containing I11Piper longum, Embelia ribesI11and borax in equal amount, was investigated in 254 women covering 4694 cycles for contraceptive property. Oral administration of drug in a dose of 1 gm / day gave very good results. Drug failure was observed only in 4 women. Pregnancy due to drug omission was found in 26 women, Minor side effects were observed in 17 cases. Fertility appeared normal after discontinuation of the drug. Clinical trial were conducted with Vidangadi yoga (a herbal preparation containing I11Embelia ribesI11 seeds, I11Hibiscus rosa-sinensisI11 flowers and I11Ferula asafoetidaI11 oleo-gum resin) for its antifertility activity. The drug was found to be very effective and showed no toxic effects. AC-4, a composite drug containing I11Embelia ribes, Laccardia lacca, Areca catechuI11 and I11Saraca asocaI11 in equal parts, when administered orally (1 gm./day in two divided doses) to 281 women for 15 days (4th day of menstrual cycle to 18th day) exhibited good contraceptive activity. There was no pregnancy due to drug failure after 10th cycle. No toxic symptoms or severe side effects were noticed. Powders of Vidanga and Tankana in a dose of 2 gm twice a day, after meals, were administered in 150 fertile women for 6 months. 58 percent of women were benefited who followed the medication for six months continuously and no pregnancy was recorded for two years of follow up. However, it was noted that cycle-wise result was 80 per cent successful. It was concluded that Tankana, Vidanga and Pippali Churna, administered for 5 days, can be used for 6 months to prevent pregnancy for 24 months. Solid extract prepared from the decoction of I11Holarrhena antidysentericaI11 ( bark and seeds), I11Berberis aristataI11 (wood), I11Embelia ribesI11 (fruit), I11Cyperus rotundusI11 (tuber), I11Aegle marmelosI11 (fruit pulp) and I11Butea monospermaI11 (seeds), in a clinical trial on 25 patients of diarrhoea and dysentery, showed complete cure rate of 80 per cent with an average 3.3 days treatment, without any toxic effect.

The chloroform extract of F. religiosa possessed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity with a zone of inhibition of 10â21mm. The methanolic extracts possessed moderate antibacterial activity against a few bacterial strains. There was less antibacterial activity or none at all using aqueous extracts. The extracts of F. religiosa were found to be active against Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum. The extracts from the leaves exhibited considerable and variable inhibitory effects against most of the microorganisms tested.[18,19] Anthelmintic activity F. religiosa bark methanolic extract was 100% lethal for Haemonchus contortus worms.[20] The stem and bark extracts of F. religiosa proved lethal to Ascaridia galli in vitro. The latex of some species of Ficus (Moraceae), i.e., Ficus inspida, F. carica was also reported to have anthelmintic activity against Syphacia obvelata, Aspiculuris tetraptera, and Vampirolepis nana.[21] The pharmacological studies on F. glabrata latex with live Ascaris demonstrated a lethal effect at concentrations reduced to 0.05% latex in physiological saline solution. It has been accepted that anthelmintic activity is due to a proteolytic fraction called ficin. It is evident from above that methanolic extracts of F. religiosa possibly exerted anthelmintic effect because of ficin.[22] Immunomodulatory activity The immunomodulatory effect of alcoholic extract of the bark of F. religiosa (moraceae) was investigated in mice. The study was carried out by various hematological and serological tests. Administration of extract remarkably ameliorated both cellular and humoral antibody response. It is concluded that the extract possessed promising immunostimulant properties.[23] Antioxidant activity The literature showed that the antioxidative properties of the extract of F. religiosa fruit and bark were done using different solvents. They were evaluated on the basis of oil stability index together with their radical scavenging ability against 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH).[24] The oxidative stress and oxidative damage to tissues are common end points of chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Oxidative stress in diabetes coexists with a reduction in the antioxidant status, which can further increase the deleterious effects of free radicals. The aqueous extract of F. religiosa reduces oxidative stress in experimentally induced type 2 diabetes rats. Type 2 diabetic rats gained relatively less weight during the course of development as compared to normal rats. Decrease in uptake of glucose, free fatty acids from circulation, and accelerated Î²-oxidation in adipose tissue lead to weight loss in diabetes. The aqueous extract of F. religiosa improved the body weight of diabetic rats.[25] Aqueous extract of F. religiosa modulated the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the diabetic rats dose dependently and also decreased catalase (CAT) activity. It could be possible due to less availability of NADPH or gradual decrease in erythrocyte CAT concentration by excessive generation of O2++ inactivates the enzyme. Since the activity of an enzyme depends upon its substrate, depletion of glutathione (GSH) may be the reason for decreased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Aqueous extract of F. religiosa bark had upregulated the CAT and GSH-Px activities. Drug at higher dose (200 mg/kg) was better effective in modulating the enzyme.[26] The methanolic extract of F. religiosa leaf inhibits the production of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated microglia via the mitogen activation protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by using cell viability assay, nitric oxide assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The extract exerts strong anti-inflammatory properties in microglial activation. It is likely that extract has a neuroprotective effect against inflammation by inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and cytokines.[27] Recently, the methanolic extract of F. religiosa has been reported to have neurotrophic effects and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity.[28] Wound-healing activity The effect of hydroalcoholic extract of F. religiosa leaves on experimentally induced wounds in rats using different wound models results in dose-dependent wound-healing activity in excision wound, incision wound, and burn wound. A formulation of leaves extract was prepared in emulsifying ointment at a concentration of 5% and 10% and applied to the wounds. In excision wound and burn wound models, the extract showed significant decrease in the period of epithelization and in wound contraction (50%). A significant increase in the breaking strength was observed in an incision wound model when compared to the control. The result suggests that leaf extract of F. religiosa (both 5% and 10%) applied topically possess dose-dependent wound-healing activity.[29] Anticonvulsant activity Methanolic extract of figs of F. religiosa had anticonvulsant activity against maximum electroshock (MES) and picrotoxin-induced convulsions, with no neurotoxic effect, in a dose-dependent manner. F. religiosa extract showed a significant protection in MES and picrotoxin-induced convulsion models in a dose-dependent manner. There was a significant decrease in the duration of tonic hind limb extension at all the three doses of extract (25, 50, and 100mg/kg) in MES model with maximum protection observed at 100mg/kg dose, as compared to control group. The anticonvulsant activity of the extract at 100mg/kg was found to be comparable to phenytoin-treated group; similarly, treatment with extract caused a dose-dependent delay of the latency to clonic convulsions in picrotoxin-induced convulsion model. However significant increase in the latency to clonic convulsions was observed only at 50 and 100mg/kg dose of extract as compared to control group. F. religiosa extract increased the threshold of MES and picrotoxin-induced convulsions with no neurotoxic effects, in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of antiepileptic effect of extract by cyproheptadine pretreatment showed that the extract might be mediating its effect via modulating serotonin-dependent GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurotransmission.[30] Hypolipidemic activity Dietary fiber content of food namely peepalbanti (F. religiosa), cellulose, and lignin were predominating constituents in peepalbanti, fed at 10% dietary level to rats, induced a greater resistance to hyperlipidemia than cellulose. Teent had the most pronounced hypocholesterolemic effect that appeared to operate through increased fecal excretion of cholesterol as well as bile acids. Dietary hemicellulose showed a significant negative correlation with serum and liver cholesterol and a significant positive correlation with fecal bile acids. The dietary fiber influenced total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids of the liver to varying extents.[31] Hypoglycemic activity Î²-Sitosterol-D-glycoside was isolated from the root bark of F. religiosa, which has a peroral hypoglycemic activity.[32] Oral administration of F. religiosa bark extract at the doses of 25, 50, and 100mg/kg was studied in normal, glucose-loaded, and STZ (streptozotocin) diabetic rats. The three doses of bark extract produced significant reduction in blood glucose levels in all the models. The effect was more pronounced in 50 and 10mg/kg than 25mg/kg. F. religiosa also showed significant increase in serum insulin, body weight, and glycogen content in liver and skeletal muscle of STZ-induced diabetic rats, while there was significant reduction in the levels of serum triglyceride and total cholesterol. F. religiosa also showed significant antilipid peroxidative effect in the pancreas of STZ-induced diabetic rats. The results indicate that aqueous extract of F. religiosa bark possesses significant antidiabetic activity.[33] View Reference", "pharmacology_reference": "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/view_ref.ajax.php?receive=355&flag=1", "chemical_composition": "The stem bark of F. religiosa are reported of phenols, tannins, steroids, alkaloids and flavonoids, Î²-sitosteryl-D-glucoside, vitamin K, n-octacosanol, methyl oleanolate, lanosterol, stigmasterol, lupen-3-one.[10].

The benzene extract of I11H. rosa-sinensisI11 showed antifertility effect in rats. The ethanol extract showed an effect on sex ration in favour of male pups at birth. Flowers collected in winter season showed maximum post-coital antifertility activity. Total alcoholic and benzene extracts showed dose dependent antiestrogenic activity in ovariectomised albino rats and significantly decreased ovarian, uterine and pituitary weight. Benzene extract of flowers had antiovulatory, antiimplantation and abortifacient activities. The benzene extract produced dose dependent antifertility activity mediated via interruption in implantation. It inhibited the hyper permeability of endometrium capillaries. The 50% ethanol and benzene extracts administered orally showed partial antagonism with estradiol disproportionate on KP11+P11 content of uterine flushings in ovariectomised rats. Aqueous infusion of flowers reduced the duration of oestrous cycle in albino rabbits. The aqueous extract of the flowers lowered the lactate dehydrogenase content in males of I11Rhinopoma kinneari.I11 Oral administration of benzene extract affected spermatogenesis and endocrine functions of the testis of male albino rats. Ethanol (80 per cent) extract was reported to possess antiviral activity. C11ToxicologyC11 Alcoholic and aqueous extracts of roots were found toxic in mice. LDB1150B11 of the ethanolic extract of leaves was 1533Â± 25 mg/kg i.p. in albino mice. The approximate LD B1150B11 of the ethanolic extract (50%) of whole plant (excluding roots) was 1000 mg /kg i.p. in mice. C11Therapeutic Evaluation C11 An uncontrolled clinical trial using the ethanolic extract of I11H. rosa-sinensisI11 flowers was carried out on 21 women in the reproductive age group by administering 750 mg/day in 3 divided doses from the 7th to 22nd day of menstrual cycle (total of 229 cycles). Fourteen women did not have pregnancy for 4 years, whereas 7 women dropped out of trial. In another uncontrolled clinical study on 20 patients of mild to moderate hypertension, powdered Japa flowers (6 to 9 gm per day in divided doses) were reported to produce significant reduction in the blood pressure, the effect on the diastolic pressure being more marked than on systolic. Leucosol- H, a composite drug containing I11Santalum album, Amaranthus polygamus, A. spinosus, Berberis aristata, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Sida cordifolia, Aegle marmelosI11 and I11Ficus bengalensis,I11 was administered (10 ml, twice a day) to 15 patients of leucorrhoea for two weeks. Complete relief from symptoms was observed in 62% cases. A clinical study on 30 patients suffering from hypertension and hypercholesterolemia with a Siddha drug, Anna Pavala Sindhooram, containing Japa as one of the ingredients, indicates that the drug is efficacious in reducing the cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides. However, on withdrawal of the drug there was slow increase in lipids. Clinical trials were conducted with Vidangadi yoga (a herbal preparation containing Embelia ribes seeds. I11Hibiscus rosa-sinensisI11 flowers and Ferula foetida oleo-gum resin) for its antifertility activity. The drug was found to be quite effective with no toxic effects.

The plant is commonly used for bleeding disorders like menorrhagia, dysentery with blood and mucus, and piles. The root powder or decoction is used. The juice of freshly crushed leaves is used internally and externally in piles. A Preliminary clinical trial, in 9 women with menorrhagia, exhibited promising results with relief in severity of bleeding. It is also applied externally to fissures, skin wounds and ulcers. Its action on small blood vessels is implicated in its hemostatic property.

Some uncontrolled clinical studies have found these preparations to be effective in improving libido and performance in man. A study was made to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of HP-200, derived from I11Mucuna pruriensI11, in patients with Parkinsonâs disease. Sixty patients with Parkinsonâs disease (46 male and 14 female) with a mean age of 59+ /-9 years were treated in an open study for 12 weeks. Of these, 26 patients were taking synthetic levodopa / carbidopa formulations before treatment with HP-200, and the remaining 34 were levodopa naive. HP-200, a powder (supplied as 7.5 g sachet), was mixed with water and given orally. The Unified Parkinsonâs Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used at baseline and periodically during the 12-week evaluation. Statistically significant reductions in Hoehn and Yahr stage and UPDRS scores were seen from baseline to the end of the 12- week treatment (p<0.0001, t-test). The group mean (+/- SD) dose for optimal control of symptoms was 6+/-3 sachets. Adverse effects were seen in clinical laboratory reports. HP-200, developed from an alternative medicine source, Ayurveda, was found to be an effective treatment for patients with Parkinsonâs disease.

The plant increased the physical endurance and prevented stress-induced ulcers. In general pharamcology the azueous extract showed hypotensive activity and inhibited the smooth muscle contraction induced by acetylcholine, carbachol and histamine. It also potentiated the hexobarbitone sleeping time. Protective action against histamine-induced bronchospasm has been shown in animals. C11Clinical UsageC11 A tea prepared with the leaves of Tulsi is commonly used in cough, cold, mild indigestion, diminished appetite and malaise. The solid extract of Tulsi, in a dose of 500 mg x 3 for one week, significantly relieved the breathlessness in 20 patients with tropical eosinophilia. There was however no reduction in the eosinophilcount in peripheral blood. It is commonly used with black pepper in bronchial asthma. An oil exlacted from Tulsi is used as drops in ear infections. Fungal and bacterial infections of skin are treated with Tulsi juice. The seeds are used as a general tonic.

C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 In a clinical trial involving 160 children (1-12 years of age) at the Indian Institute of Research in Yoga & Allied Sciences, Tirupati, I11P. fraternusI11 has been claimed to be effective in treatment of infective hepatitis. Out of the 160 children, 101 cases were cured and 59 cases dropped out. In majority of cases, disappearance of jaundice, hepatic tenderness and bile salts and pigments from urine was observed in 2nd week. Improvement of appetite was more quicker and pronounced than other clinical features in majority of cases. No side effects were observed. A clinical trial was conducted on 25 patients of jaundice. The patients were given 1 gm. Bhumyamalki in tablet form thrice daily for 8 days and 500 mg. t.d.s. for the next 8 days. Complete relief was observed in 22 patients (88%) and partial relief in 2 (8%). One of the patients showed no response. The time required for clinical improvement was 2-7 days. In a preliminary study, carriers of hepatitis B virus were treated with a preparation of I11Phyllanthus amarusI11 for 30 days. 22 of 37 (59%) treated patients had lost hepatitis B surface antigen when tested 15-20 days after the end of the treatment compared with only 1 of 23 (4%) placebo- treated controls. Some subjects have been followed for up to 9 months. In no case has the surface antigen returned. Clinical observation revealed few or no toxic effects. The encouraging results of this preliminary study recommend continued evaluation of this plant and the active principles isolated from it. In another clinical trial I11Phyllanthus amarusI11 was administered to 30 asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) in a dosage of 250 to 500 mg thrice daily for 4 to 8 weeks. None of the 30 subjects cleared HbsAg. I11Phyllanthus amarusI11 was well tolerated, with no clinical side effects or changes in the organ profiles for safety evaluation. It was concluded that I11Phyllanthus amarusI11 is not effective in clearing HbsAg in asymptomatic carriers of the antigen. In another clinical study extracts of three species of I11PhyllanthusI11 were tested on the serologic status of 123 patients with chronic hepatitis B at Henan Institute of Medical Sciences, China. Eleven patients received an extract of I11Phyllanthus amarusI11 provided from India. Forty-two patients received I11Phyllanthus niruriI11, gathered from Hainan Province in China, and 35 patients received an extract of I11Phyllanthus urinaria,I11 which had no herbal therapy. The detectable hepatitis B e-antigen from their serum and more likely to seroconvert hepatitis B e-antibody status from negative to positive than were patients given either of the two preparations. No patient changed status with respect of hepatitis B s-antigen. A study was made to know whether the powders of I11Phyllanthus amarusI11 plants favourably influence the duration of disease in patients with acute virus B hepatitis when compared to placebo. The powders of the plant were given in capsule form (300 mg capsules-3 capsules thrice daily) and an antacid powder in similar capsule was used a placebo. Persons with encephalopathy, preexisting medical conditions or serum bilirubin above 350 iu/l were excluded from the study. Fifty seven patients were randomized to receive either the placebo (28 cases) or the drug (28 cases). The two groups were comparable at the time of entry. Two cases from the placebo and one from the drug group dropped out of the study. The duration of disease (time taken for bilirubin to come to below 2mg%) was taken as the outcome measure. The duration of disease in the two groups was compared by Coxâs proportional hazards analysis after adjusting for the variables that influence the duration of jaundice. Only initial serum bilirubin was an independent predictor of jaundice. The analysis showed that Phyllanthus amarus powders did not significantly reduce the duration of jaundice in persons with virus B hepatitis.

C11ToxicologyC11 LDB1150B11 of the 50% ethanolic extract of whole plant was found to be>1000mg/ kg i.p. in mice. The juice of leaves was found nontoxic up to a dose of 1000mg/100gm in mice. Leaf extract at high concentrations induces oxidative damage to biological membranes. Chewing of betel quid (betel leaf, betel nut, trace amounts of lime and catechu) lead to substantial rise in the salivary nitrite levels and the possible relevance of these to the of oral cancer. Excessive indulgence in chewing for long periods is liable to produce dental caries, pyorrhea alveolaris, oral sepsis, dyspepsia, palpitation, neurosis and slow cerebration. In moderate doses, the betel oil exhibits a depressant action on the central nervous system of mammals, lethal doses produce deep narcosis leading to death within few hours. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 A clinical trial was conducted on 80 patients of bronchial asthma of varied etiology. Powder of I11Calotropis giganteaI11 (root bark) and I11Piper nigrumI11 (fruit) were mixed with I11Piper betelI11 leaf juice and the paste thus obtained was made into pills, each weighing 200 mg. The drug was administered in doses of two pills, i.e. 400 mg a day with yew decoction (Thaleespathri kasayam) for 45 days.

A clinical trial was conducted on 20 patients of oligomenorrhoea, in which a proprietary herbal preparation, consisting I11S. indicaI11 as one of the ingredients, was administered in doses of 2 tsf b.d. for three months and then followed up at regular intervals of one month. Out of 20, 4 patients conceived during study period which indicates that preparation is beneficial in infertility and scanty menstruation.

C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 Efficacy of Rasnadi Guggulu compound (consisting of I11Strychnos nuxvomica, Aconitum ferox, Semecarpus anacardium, Alpinia galanga, Pluchea lanceolataI11 and I11Commiphora mukulI11) on patients of rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated. It was found to be effective in reducing inflammatory oedema and management of rheumatoid arthritis. It also exhibited analgesic activity in experimental albino rats. A compound herbal preparation, containing I11Picrorhiza kurroa, Commiphora mukul,I11 Myrobalans (Triphala), I11Boerhaavia diffusaI11 and I11Strychnos nux-vomica I11 was evaluated in a clinical trial indicated alleviation of the symptoms within 4 days, whereas jaundice was reported to have disappeared in 80 per cent of the patients within 7 days. The drug restored the liver function to normal as assessed by a fall of serum bilirubin as well as SGOT and SGPT levels. No side effect was observed during therapy. 50 persons above the age of 60 (male and female), having geriatric problems, were treated with an Ayurvedic geriatric drug (dose 2 tabs, 3 times a day) for a period of 6 weeks. 32 persons showed benefit with reduction in their complaints. Others failed to show benefits. Drug improved the conditions of patients by improving bowel function, stimulation of appetite and rejuvenation. The drug contained medicinal plants like I11Crocus sativa, Myristica fragrans, Terminalia arjuna, Withania somnifera, Asparagus racemosusI11 and I11Strychnos nux-vomicaI11 etc. View Reference", "pharmacology_reference": "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/view_ref.ajax.php?receive=120&flag=1", "chemical_composition": "Glucoside-loganin (fruits); brucine, strychnine, vomicine and methoxystrychinine (leaves and root bark); C-mavacurine, strychnochrysine (roots); brucine, strychnine, pseudobrucine, S224- & Ã- colubrines, vomicine, novacine, P-hydroxybenzoic, vanilic, 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic, sinapic and syringic acids, kaempferol, quercetin and 3â-O âmethyl-quercetin, protostrychnine, normacussine B and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystrychnine, 3-methoxyicajine (plant); loganin, 4-hydroxystrychnine, N-methyl-sec-pseudo- Ã-colubrine, strychnine, brucine, 15-hydroxy-3-methoxy strychnine (seed).

The stem bark of I11T. arjunaI11 is a potent antihypercholesterolaemic agent. It reduced the total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, free fatty acids, phospholipids and triglycerides and elevated HDL in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. Seventy per cent ethanolic extract of the stem bark showed hypotensive and bradycardiac effects in experimental animals. Aqueous and 95 percent ethanolic extracts exhibited myocardial depressant property . Polar fraction of ethanolic extract relaxed norepinephrine contracted rat aorta. Stem bark increased endogenous superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione, catalase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the heart. It also protected the heart from oxidative stress ischaemic-reperfusion injury in vitro. Clinically stem bark extract demonstrated antianginal activity and ameliorative effect in hypertension and heart failure. Ethanolic extract showed antifertility activity in albino rats and antifungal activity against dermatophytes. Methanolic extract and ellagic acid isolated from the stem bark showed antimutagenic activity. C11ToxicologyC11 LDB1150B11 of the aqueous extract of the bark is 250 mg /kg. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 Several studies have been made to assess the efficacy of I11Terminalia arjunaI11 bark in cardiac disorders. Decoction of bark powder was found more useful in hypertensive heart disease as compared to congestive heart failure. Alcoholic decoction of bark was found to be beneficial in stable cases of ischaemic heart disease. Prolonged use of this drug brought sense of well being in patients and increased euglobulin lysis time and prothrombin time. The drug also showed electrocardiographic improvement. A particular patient, an adult male who developed Strokes- Adams attacks following acute chest pain, became well after three months use of crude powder of I11T. arjuna.I11 In another study 500 mg crude powder of I11T. arjunaI11was administered in 30 stable angina pain. It was also noted to be useful in cases of ischaemic heart diseases associated with rhythm disturbances, particularly premature beats. The drug was found to be beneficial in modifying various known coronary risk factors like obesity, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and circulating catecholamines in these patients. No significant side effects were observed in these patients. Solidified aqueous extract of Arjuna bark when administered in doses of 500 mg b.d. for 3 months along with antianginal drugs proved useful in reducing Tread mill test positivity and increase in exercise tolerance in 25 patients of Angina pectoris. However there was no reduction in composition of antianginal drugs. A clinical trial was taken on 51 patients of coronary heart disease to assess the effect of I11T. arjuna.I11 All the patients were administered with 2 cap of 500 mg each containing Arjuna bark powder in morning break fast and in evening after meal with milk. The patients were advised to walk in fresh air with a gradual increment in distance with permission of yogic exercise, if any already doing. This treatment was continued for four months followed up each month. The studies revealed statistically significant positive results. Reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, serum cholesterol and HDL and LDL cholesterol was noticed. The patients suffering from Vvyana-Bala-Vaishamya vis-Ã -vis hypertension are at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Borderline hypertensives or patients with high systolic blood pressure are equally at risk as per W.H.O expert meet. The modern medicines are associated with so many side effects. Thus a lead was taken to formulate a combination with Ayurvedic drugs which can affect the severity of hypertension. The extracts of Arjuna, Vacha, Brahmi and Jatamansi when combined in equal doses were administered to 22 hypertensive patients with no lipid derangements. A symptomatic improvement with fall in blood â pressure (both systolic and diastolic) was noted. The improvement was slow and steady and was maximum after 3 months of treatment with Arjuna Vacadi Yoga (given compound). Various symptoms viz., Anidra, Dourbalya, Shirahshoola, Kshubdhata, Shrama and Brahma were grade as per their severity and recorded. A shift in symptoms grade score was observed after three months of treatment i.e. patients showed a generalized improvement. Administration of a herbal drug containing I11Terminalia arjuna, Emblica officinalis, Ocimum sanctumI11 and I11Withania somniferaI11resulted in significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There was a significant reduction in body mass index in patients treated with drug when compared to those conventional drugs alone. Similarly, a significant decline in levels of serum cholesterol, triglycerides and elevation in HDL cholesterol was observed at the end of three months in the indigenous drug group patients. About 6.7 per cent patients in this group developed fresh ST-T changes as compared to improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and reduction in left ventricular mass was also noted in this group. No major clinical or biochemical side effects were noted in patients on adjuvant indigenous therapy. On the basis of available experimental evidences, the drug is considered as cardio protective, and not as cardiotonic as previously assumed. Its antianginal properties along with its potentials of modifying various coronary risk factors opens up larger opportunities for its use in primary and secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease.

C11ToxicologyC11 The active crude alcoholic extract were assayed for cellular toxicity to fresh sheep erythrocytes and found to have no cellular toxicity. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 A clinical trial to evaluate antitussive and antiasthmatic effect of Bibhitaka was conducted on 93 cases of different age groups ranging from 1 to 79 years. 61 cases were suffering from Kasa (cough) of different types, 12 cases from Shwasa (dyspnoea) and 20 cases from Kasa-Shwasa mixed in nature (cough with dyspnoea). Powder of Bibhitaka whole fruit (rind with nut) was administered orally in doses ranging from 2-6 gm thrice daily with fresh water. 22 cases had complete relief with no pathological abnormality, 27 cases showed significant relief, whereas 35 cases showed only symptomatic improvement and marked as moderately relieved. The observations and results reflected that Bibhitaka possesses bronchodilatory, antispasmodic, antiphlegmatic, expectorant, sedative and antiasthmatic effects.

The urine sugar was brought down much earlier than blood sugar. A clinical study was conducted on 50 cases of vitiligo with a compound herbomineral preparation, viz., Ayush-57, containing I11Terminalia belliricaI11 as one of the ingredients. After 12 weeks of treatment 20 cases showed improvement. The results indicate stimulation of pigment metabolism. However, no concrete conclusion was drawn as the treatment required longer period and bigger samples to declare the utility of the drug. In a preliminary clinical trial on patients of bleeding piles, oral administration of multiherbal composite drug containing I11Berberis aristata, Holarrhena antidysenterica, Picrorrhiza kurroa, Mesua ferrea, Terminalia chebula, T. belericaI11 and I11Emblica officinalisI11 to 22 patients showed significant decrease in bleeding and constipation by the fourth week of therapy.

Immunosuppressive, immunostimulant, antileishmanial, antioxidant, antiendotoxic, hypotensive, diuretic. The water and ethanolic extract of stem inhibited the cyclophosphamide induced immunosuppression. Aqueous extract of the stem showed antiinflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties in rats. In clinical studies, it also showed immunosuppressive effect in obstructive jaundice patients, antioxidant activity and amelioration of cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 A composite herbal drug containing I11Tinospora cordifolia, Withania somnifera, Myristica fragrans, Eclipta alba, Bergenia ligulata, Asparagus racemousI11and I11Tribulus terrestrisI11 has been found to be efficacious in 30 patients of calculi. It has been reported that the calculi were discharged through urine as calcium carbonate or calcium oxalate crystals within 15-30 days. Other symptoms associated with calculi were also relieved of. A compound preparation composed of I11Cinnamomum tamala, Aegle Marmelos , Gymnema sylvestre, Pterocarpus marsupium, Azadirachta indica, Tinospora cordifoliaI11and I11Trigonella foenum-graecumI11was tried in 20 patients of diabetes. Dose was determined on the basis of conditions of patients as 2 capsules t.d.s to insulin dependent cases, 2 capsules b.d. to moderate cases and 1 capsule t.d.s to mild diabetics for atleast 3 weeks. It was concluded that the drug provides a total beneficial therapy in all types if diabetics and tends to increase insulin secretion from islets of pancreas. A compound proprietary medicine containing I11Mucuna prureinsI11 (seeds), I11Tinospora cordifoliaI11 (stem), I11Withania somniferaI11 (stem), I11Glycyrrhiza glabraI11 (stem), I11Myristica fragransI11 (fruit) and I11Tribulus terrestrisI11 (fruit) was administered orally (2 tablets b.d.) to 56 patients of sexual dysfunction for 4 weeks. An excellent improvement in erection, duration of coitus and ejaculation and post-coital satisfaction has been reported. In another trial 60 cases with specific sexual problems were treated with the same medicine in doses of 2 tablets twice a day and its effects on sexual performance of two third cases showed subjective improvement ranging from 25% to 100%. The remaining one third were refractory to the treatment. Efficacy of a proprietary herbal preparation consisting of I11Eugenia jambolana, Tinospora cordifolia, Pterocarpus marsupium, Ficus glomerata, Momordica charantiaI11and I11Ocimum sanctumI11 was evaluated on 28 cases of persistant post prandial hyperglycaemia. After 12 weeks of treatment a persistant fall in fasting and post prandial blood glucose levels was recorded. A clinical trial was taken on 25 patients of type II diabetes to study the adjuvant effect of a herbo-mineral proprietary preparation in which I11Tinospora cordifoliaI11 was one of the constituents. The drug contained 19 administered in the doses of 1-2 tablets t.d.s in addition to the regular sulphylureas over a period of 6 weeks. The herbo-mineral preparation showed improvement in glycaemic parameters, viz., fasting blood sugar levels, post lunch blood sugar levels and Fructosamine levels. This indicates the proprietary medicine is useful adjuvant in poorly controlled type âII diabetes. In a clinical trial of 20 patients of infective hepatitis were treated with tablets prepared from stem of I11T. cordifolia.I11 Four tablets (500 mg. each) were administered thrice daily with fresh water for 4 weeks. The majority of the cases i.e. 15 cases (75%) were cured and 5 cases (25% ) were improved. 34 cases suffering from amavata (rehumatoid arthritis) were treated with Suddha guggulu and Guduchyadi kwatha for 6 weeks at Regional Research Institute (Ayurveda), Jaipur. The cases were assessed weekly and clinical observations made by the physicians. The results noted after 6 weeks showed that 27 cases had marked relief and 4 cases moderate relief.

C11ToxicologyC11 The seeds of I11T. terrestrisI11were found to be toxic to the liver of rats. C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 14 patients of Vrikkasmari (renal calculi) and 16 patients of Gavini-asmari (ureteric calculi) were treated with a herbinomineral combination containing Bergenia ligulata and I11Tribulus terrestris.I1128.57% patient of renal calculi and 75% patients of ureteric calculi passed their calculi completely and in other patients there was marked or partial expulsion of calculi or dislogdement of calculi or there was change in shapes, sizes and consistencies of calculi. A composite herbal drug containing I11Tinospora cordifolia, Withania somnifera, Myristica fragrans. Eclipta alba, Bergenia ligulata, Asparagus racemousI11and I11Tribulus terrestrisI11has been found to be efficacious in 30 patients calculi. It has been reported that calculi were discharged through urine as calcium carbonate or calcium oxalate crystals within 15-30 days. Other symptoms associated with calculi were relieved of. A compound preparation containing I11Mucuna prureinsI11 (seeds), I11Tinospora cordifoliaI11 (stem), I11Withania somniferaI11 (stem), I11Glycyrrhiza glabraI11 (stem), I11Myristica fragransI11 (fruit) and I11Tribulus terrestris I11 (fruit) was administered orally (2 tablets b.d) to 56 patients of sexual dysfunction fro 4 weeks. An excellent improvement in erection, duration of coitus and ejaculation and post-coital satisfaction has been reported. A compound preparation, containing I11Tribulus terrestrisI11 as one of the ingredients, administered to patients, 2 tablets two times a day for 10 to 21 days, was found effective in urolithiasis and crystalluria without any side effects. A compound preparation, containing Gokshura, Varuna, Amalaki and Punarnava, administered to a patient suffering from Polycythaemia vera, in a dose of 20 ml decoction twice a day for 15 days and continued for three months, brought Hb%, RBC, WBC, PCV, ESR, blood urea, platelet count to normal level. Varunadi kvatha (a composite Ayurvedic drug containing I11Crataeva religiosa, Tribulus terrestris, Zingiber officinale, Bergenia ligulata, Woodfordia FruticosaI11and Jaggery) was given in dose of 20 ml with water before lunch and dinner to 50 patients having urinary complaints. Excellent results were obtained in 64%of the patients and 26% showed moderate relief. In a clinical study, 406 cases of coronary heart disease were treated with saponin of I11Tribulus terrestris.I11 The results showed that the saponin has the action of dilating coronary artery and improving the coronary circulation. It has shown better effects on improving ECG of myocardial ischaemia as compared to control group treated with a Chinese medicine. It has no adverse reaction on blood system and hepatic and renal systems. Neither has it had any side effects. Effect of Dashmula, of which I11Tribulus terrestrisI11 is one of the constituents, on management of sensory and motor disorders pertaining to sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow amongst the patients presenting with primary neurological disorders have been investigated. A significant improvement in the nerve conduction velocity was observed. The pattern of âHâ reflex also improved in all these patients along with clinical response. Out of 50 patients of nutritional neuropathy 40 patients showed improvement in nerve conduction velocity. Similarly lumbago-sciatica syndrome also showed remarkable improvement.

C11Therapeutic EvaluationC11 In a clinical study 30 cases of Vatavyadhis (20 trial cases and 10 control cases) were treated with Nirgundi. The drug was found more efficacious in Sandhigata vata (non-inflammatory type joint pain), but not much useful in the treatment of Amavata (inflammatory i.e. rheumatoid arthrites). 22 patients of Girva Hundanam (cervical spondylosis) were treated for 21 days in 3 groups viz., Suddha Guggulu (Commiphora mukul) group and mixed group. Improvement was observed 66.66% in NPPS, 73.3% in Guggulu and 100% in mixed group. Dry powder of I11V. negundoI11 leaf (250 mg) was fed everyday with little cold water to patients suffering from low sperm count for 120 days regularly. After 25 days, sharp increment in sperm count was found on every 15th day check up since the commencement of the therapy to the patients lying under rest condition. After 75 days, optimum increment of nearly 3.5 times in a sperm count has been seen. The ratio of live and dead sperm is also increased to optimum level by 60 days from 1:1 to nearly 4:1 level. Withdrawal of the drug affects the sperm count and its slopes down to base level within another 120 days. Clinical studies were made in refractive error and cataract cases with a herbal preparation containing I11Vitex negundoI11 as one of the constituents. Some improvements were noted in associated symptoms bringing a general amelioration of the eyes. A subjective improvement of vision was reported by some cases of refractive errors. No side effect was reported. A clinical trial was conducted with proprietary gel consisting of I11Vitex negundo, Curcuma longa, Azadirachta indica, Elettaria cardamomum, Cedrus deodara, Boerhavia diffusaI11 and I11Nelumbium spesiosumI11 on 31 patients with vaginitis. All the patients were advised to apply the gel twice daily for a period of two weeks. Complete relief symptoms was observed in 73% patients within 7-14 days with no untoward manifestations. Vranshodhan taila, having Karanji oil as base, was tried in 78 patients suffering from dandruff. Observations were made after 10 applications. 57 patients were completely cured as there was no dandruff. 18 patients needed 20 applications. In 3 patients dandruff was present in considerable amount even after 20 applications. After six months rechecking, 32 patients had recurrence which indicates that periodic application of oil is needed. Other ingredients of oil were I11Nerium oleander, Terminalia chebula, Azadirachta indica, Vitex negundoI11 and I11Datura fastuosa.I11 View Reference", "pharmacology_reference": "https://nitmmedplantsdb.in/view_ref.ajax.php?receive=130&flag=1", "chemical_composition": "Leaves contain two alkaloids nishindine and hydrocotylene.
