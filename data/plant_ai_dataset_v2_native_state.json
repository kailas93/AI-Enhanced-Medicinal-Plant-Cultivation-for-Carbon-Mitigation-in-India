Cultivated in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions around the world for its edible green (red in some cultivars) seed pods, okra is used in the cuisines of many countries.The species is a perennial, often cultivated as an annual in temperate climates, often growing to around 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall. As a member of the Malvaceae, it is related to such species as cotton, cocoa, and hibiscus. The leaves are 10–20 centimetres (4–8 in) long and broad, palmately lobed with 5–7 lobes. The flowers are 4–8 cm (1+5⁄8–3+1⁄8 in) in diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base. The pollen grains are spherical and approximately 188 microns in diameter. The fruit is a capsule up to 18 cm (7 in) long with pentagonal cross-section, containing numerous seeds. The scientific name can be broken down and translated: Abelmoschus is Neo-Latin from Arabic: أَبُو المِسْك, romanized: ʾabū l-misk, lit. 'father of musk', which was likely derived from the plant's seeds displaying a sweet, musky aroma when crushed; esculentus is Latin for 'edible' or 'being fit for human consumption'. Okra is known as bhindi (pronounced [pɪɳ˩˨.ɖiː]; Punjabi: ਭਿੰਡੀ/بھنڈی/پنڈی)(pronounced [bʱɪnɖiː]; Urdu: بھنڈی) in Pakistan, where it is the national vegetable. Okro is known as Ila in Yoruba.

Despite its tropical origin, the plant is frost-hardy. Musk mallow seed oil was once frequently used as a substitute in perfumes for animal musk; however, this use is now mostly replaced by various synthetic musks due to its high cost. In her 1705 book the Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium, Maria Sibylla Merian described how the young indigenous women would string the seeds on threads and wear the seeds as decoration on their arms. She also indicated that the Indigenous people used the seeds to fatten up their chickens. It has many culinary uses. The seeds are added to coffee; unripe pods (\"musk okra\"), leaves and new shoots are eaten as vegetables.

Abies spectabilis has a wide distribution, but it has suffered from logging and deforestation, especially at the lower elevations. In 2011, IUCN assessed it as \"Near Threatened\". Abies spectabilis occurs most commonly in mountains between 1600 and 4000 meters high, especially in the Himalayas. While it does appear in strips of its kind, it is more common to find Abies spectabilis around other similar trees, such as Abies pindrow and Abies densa. Abies spectabilis is commonly confused with Abies densa. It functions best in cold and wet climates. Abies spectabilis has been brought to places outside where it originated due to humans, and while it failed to take root in North America, it can be found in the UK and Ireland, though it does not always last in the heat of summer. == References =="

It is a shrub or tree native to tropical Asia, ranging from the Himalayas and southern China through Indochina and Malesia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Abroma augustum has dark red flowers with a characteristic and unusual appearance. The leaves and stems are covered with soft bristly hairs that are very irritating to the touch. The bark yields a jute-like fiber. It is used as a traditional medicinal plant.The species was first described as Theobroma augustum (or Theobroma augusta) by Carl Linnaeus in 1768. The genus was described by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1776 with a single species Abroma fastuosum, which was illustrated and described. However, because Jacquin was renaming Theobroma augusta L., according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, he was required to use the name Abroma augustum, and A. fastuosum is an illegitimate name. The correct name of the type species, A. augustum (L.) L. f., was made in 1782 by Carl Linnaeus the Younger. Ambroma is an orthographic variant. In the greenhouse, plants bloom from late spring to early summer. Dark maroon flowers are formed in terminal panicles. Individual flowers are up to 3 inches (7.5 cm) across. Abroma augustum is propagated from seed. Seed germinate in 21–30 days at 72 °F (24 °C). == References ="

    "knowledge_text": "Vachellia farnesiana, also known as Acacia farnesiana, and previously Mimosa farnesiana, commonly known as sweet acacia, huisache, casha tree, or needle bush, is a species of shrub or small tree in the legume family, Fabaceae. Its flowers are used in the perfume industry.The plant is deciduous over part of its range, but evergreen in most locales. Growing from multiple trunks, it reaches a height of 4.6–9.1 metres (15–30 feet). The bark is whitish gray. The base of each leaf is accompanied by a pair of thorns on the branch. The dark brown fruit is a seed pod.  It was first described by Europeans under the name Acacia Indica Farnesiana in 1625 by Tobias Aldini from plants grown in Rome in the Farnese Gardens from seed collected in Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic, which germinated in 1611. Aldini included an illustration of the plant, which he contrasted with an illustration of the first known Acacia; Acacia nilotica. This first (European) illustration of the plant was later designated as the (lecto-)type. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus used Aldini's work as basis for his taxon Mimosa farnesiana. In 1806 Carl Ludwig Willdenow moved this taxon to the genus Acacia. Partly due to its wide distributional range, the taxon has attracted many synonyms. Especially in the United States, the taxonomy has been confused. In 1809, Willdenow described Acacia acicularis from Central America collected and named during Humboldt and Bonpland's scientific expedition to the Americas. "

The genus Acacia was long known not to be taxonomically monophyletic, and despite being the type species of that genus, A. nilotica has since been moved to the genus Vachellia, with the genus name Acacia being reserved for Australian species; the principle of priority, which would normally prevent such a taxonomic change, was waived with a majority vote by the International Botanical Congress in 2005. The renaming of the traditional Acacia to Vachellia remains controversial, especially in Africa, where V. nilotica is an iconic species and is widely referred to as \"the acacia\". For the new classification of this and other species historically classified under genus Acacia, see Acacia. The genus name Acacia derives from ἀκακία, which may come from the ancient Greek word ἄκις, ákis, \"thorn\", for its characteristic thorns, or may have been borrowed from a pre-Greek language.

It grows to a height of 5–12 metres (16-40'), with a trunk up to 30 cm (1') in diameter. Sudan is the source of the world's highest quality gum arabic, known locally as hashab gum in contrast to the related, but inferior, gum arabic from Red acacia or talah gum. The tree is of great economic importance for the gum arabic it produces which is used as a food additive, in crafts, and as a cosmetic. The gum is drained from cuts in the bark, and an individual tree will yield 200 to 300 grams (7 to 10 oz). Eighty percent of the world's gum arabic is produced in Sudan.

The plant is native to temperate regions of Eurasia and North America. It has been introduced as feed for livestock in New Zealand and Australia. It has some potential uses, including in traditional medicine.Achillea millefolium is an erect, herbaceous, perennial plant that produces one to several stems 0.2–1 metre (8–40 inches) in height, and has a spreading rhizomatous growth form. Cauline and more or less clasping, the leaves appear spirally and evenly along the stem, with the largest and most petiolate towards the base; they are 5–20 centimetres (2–8 in) long and fernlike, divided bipinnately or tripinnately. The inflorescence has 4 to 9 phyllaries and contains ray and disk flowers which are white to pink, blooming from March to October. There are generally 3 to 8 ray flowers, which are 3 millimetres (1⁄8 in) long and ovate to round. The tiny disk flowers range from 10 to 40. The inflorescence is produced in a flat-topped capitulum cluster and the inflorescences are visited by many insect species, and has a generalized pollination system.

Its seeds have been used as a substitute for cereal grains in famine years. The plant is used externally in the treatment of leech bites in Mizoram, India and a decoction as a diuretic. During the Chinese Liang Dynasty, Achyranthes bidentata was used for its abortion effectiveness. Chinese folk doctors would take the juices of crushed up Achyranthes bidentata and insert them into the vagina to induce abortion. This abortive technique was common among folk medicine practitioners in southern China during the Republican period. Achyranthes bidentata is now used for other things such as osteoperosis and arthritis, and known for its anti-inflammatory effects.The root of this plant is known as Achyranthis Radix [or AR in short].

These herbaceous, frequently toxic perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows. Most Aconitum species are extremely poisonous and must be handled very carefully. Several Aconitum hybrids, such as the Arendsii form of Aconitum carmichaelii, have won gardening awards—such as the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.The name aconitum comes from the Greek word ἀκόνιτον, which may derive from the Greek akon for dart or javelin, the tips of which were poisoned with the substance, or from akonae, because of the rocky ground on which the plant was thought to grow. The Greek name lycoctonum, which translates literally to \"wolf's bane\", is thought to indicate the use of its juice to poison arrows or baits used to kill wolves. The English name monkshood refers to the cylindrical helmet, called the galea, distinguishing the flower. The dark green leaves of Aconitum species lack stipules. They are palmate or deeply palmately lobed with five to seven segments. Each segment is trilobed with coarse sharp teeth. The leaves have a spiral (alternate) arrangement.

It lies completely in the temperate alpine zone. Both parks are encompassed in the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (223,674 ha) which is further surrounded by a buffer zone (5,148.57 km2). Nanda Devi National Park Reserve is in the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves. The park is open only during summer from June to October and is covered by heavy snow for the rest of the year.

There are many different plant species and taxa that grow as a plant community in these alpine tundra. These include perennial grasses, sedges, forbs, cushion plants, mosses, and lichens. Alpine plants are adapted to the harsh conditions of the alpine environment, which include low temperatures, dryness, ultraviolet radiation, wind, drought, poor nutritional soil, and a short growing season. Some alpine plants serve as medicinal plants.Alpine plants occur in a tundra: a type of natural region or biome that does not contain trees. Alpine tundra occurs in mountains worldwide. It transitions to subalpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone are known as Krummholz. With increasing elevation, it ends at the snow line where snow and ice persist through summer, also known as the Nival Zone. Alpine plants are not limited to higher elevations. However, high-elevation areas have different ecology than those growing at higher latitudes. One of the biggest distinctions is that the lower bound of a tropical alpine area is difficult to define due to a mixture of human disturbances, dry climates, and a naturally lacking tree line. The other major difference between tropical and arctic-alpine ecology is the temperature differences. The tropics have a summer/winter cycle every day, whereas the higher latitudes stay cold both day and ni"

Its leaves resemble those of the iris family. Sweet flag consists of tufts of basal leaves that rise from a spreading rhizome. The leaves are erect yellowish-brown, radical, with pink sheathing at their bases, sword-shaped, flat and narrow, tapering into a long, acute point, and have parallel veins. The leaves have smooth edges, which can be wavy or crimped. The sweet flag can be distinguished from iris and other similar plants by the crimped edges of the leaves, the fragrant odor it emits when crushed, and the presence of a spadix. Only plants that grow in water bear flowers. The fruit is a berry filled with mucus, which when ripe falls into the water and disperses by floating. The solid, triangular flower-stems rise from the axils of the outer leaves. A semi-erect spadix emerges from one side of the flower stem.

It is often found on limestone edges and in deciduous woodland; key factors are shade, low competition, and a cool, protected root run.Actaea spicata is a herbaceous perennial plant growing up to 65 cm (2 ft 2 in) tall. The basal leaves are large, biternate or bipinnate. The leaflets are more-or-less toothed. The flowers are white, with 3–6 petaloid sepals, and are produced in an erect raceme. The fruit is a berry, black when ripe and 10–13 mm (0.4–0.5 in) across. Its fruit persists for an average of 57.5 days, and bears an average of 11.4 seeds per fruit. Fruits average 90.7% water, and their dry weight includes 2.4% carbohydrates (possibly the lowest of any European fleshy fruit) and 1.0% lipids. Actaea spicata was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Two varieties have been recognized: Actaea spicata var. spicata. Europe, northwestern Asia. Actaea spicata var. acuminata (syn.

It bears a close resemblance to Actiniopteris dimorpha Pic. Serm. This species is found in hot, dry habitats, growing at the base of rocks and in crevices, but also on deep soil in shady places. It is common in deciduous woodland with perennially high temperatures and low rainfall, ranging from 500m to 1300m. The distinctive fronds issue from a prostrate rhizome and are somewhat dimorphic. The laminae are 15-45mm long and fan-shaped with a spread of some 180 degrees, the tip of each segment bearing 2–5 teeth. Tests have shown that an aqueous and ethanolic extract of Actiniopteris radiata exhibits potent analgesic properties and antibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi \"Staphylococcus aureus\" and Escherichia coli. The species also shows anti-fertility, styptic, anthelmintic, anti-tubercular and antioxidant properties.

They are typically found in dry, hot savannas of sub-Saharan Africa, where they dominate the landscape and reveal the presence of a watercourse from afar. They have traditionally been valued as sources of food, water, health remedies or places of shelter and are a key food source for many animals. They are steeped in legend and superstition. In recent years, many of the largest, oldest trees have died, for unknown reasons. Other common names for the baobab include monkey-bread tree, upside-down tree, and cream of tartar tree.African baobabs are trees that often grow as solitary individuals, and are large and distinctive elements of savanna or scrubland vegetation. They grow to a height of 5–25 metres (16–82 feet). The trunk is typically very broad and fluted or cylindrical, often with a buttressed, spreading base. Trunks may reach a diameter of 10–14 m (33–46 ft), and may be made up of multiple stems fused around a hollow core.

Many are succulents and some are pachycauls. Some have fibrous root systems and some have tubers. Adenia can be found in a wide variety of habitat types, from dry African deserts to wet Southeast Asian rainforests. There are about 100 species in the genus. Adenia have alternately arranged leaves borne on petioles. There are two glands located near the attachment of the leaf blade to the petiole. Most species are dioecious. Inflorescences of a few to many flowers occur in the leaf axils. There is a stipe below the flower. The calyx has five lobes and the five petals are usually smaller than the sepals and may be whitish or greenish. The male flower has five stamens. In the female flower these are reduced to staminodes. There are three styles tipped with stigmas that may be long-hairy to very woolly. The fruit is a red capsule. Each black seed has a fleshy aril. Adenia species can be difficult to identify and distinguish as individuals of a species can be variable. One plant can have leaves of varying shape"

It was lectotypified by R.E.G. Pichi-Sermolli in 1957 based on an illustration by James Petiver. The identifiability of this illustration was disputed, leading some authorities to deprecate A. philippense as a nomen dubium and use the next available name for the taxon, Adiantum lunulatum Burm.f.. Burman conferred this specific epithet based on its half-moon shaped pinnae. However, Christopher Fraser-Jenkins located the original material and drawing of the lectotype sent to Petiver by Georg Joseph Kamel in the Sloane Herbarium, making clear the application of the name A. philippense. Adiantum philippense grows in a creeping or semi-erect position. Its fronds are arched and tufted. The fern is notably overall very glabrous and smooth. It grows on streambanks, often on rocks in forests and woodland. Adiantum philippense can be found across south-east Asia.

The leaf is trifoliate, alternate, each leaflet 5–14 cm (2–5+1⁄2 in) x 2–6 cm (3⁄4–2+1⁄4 in), ovate with tapering or pointed tip and rounded base, untoothed or with shallow rounded teeth. Young leaves are pale green or pinkish, finely hairy while mature leaves are dark green and completely smooth. Each leaf has 4–12 pairs of side veins which are joined at the margin. The flowers are 1.5 "

It has a native distribution incorporating much of Africa (including Madagascar), and the south-west and south of Asia, and it has become adventitious in northern Australia.The plant is herbaceous, multi-stemmed and soft-wooded and bears broad leaves; it often has an erect habit and grows to a height of about 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in). In Western Australia it tends to grow in sandy soils especially along drainage lines. It flowers between January and October. Diplospory, a type of Agamospermy, occurs during the development of female gametophyte in the ovule and hence reduction division does not take place in the Megaspore mother cell. The diploid egg is unfertilized and forms the embryo. Hence daughter plants are exactly clones of the mother. The species uses C4 carbon fixation. It is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are produced on separate individuals. This herb is deep rooted, and is used as soil binder in desert reclamation. It is used for fuel and for fodder for goats. In traditional medicine the seeds are believed to cure headaches. A gargle is made from the plant to try to treat toothache. The plant has naturalised in northern regions of Australia, as an alien introduction, and is cultivated and utilised by the indigenous peoples of some countries. The thick, white inflorescences have traditionally been harvested in Arabia for stuffing cushions and saddle pads. To"

Its large leaves 10–20 cm (3.9–7.9 in) long by 2–6 cm (0.79–2.36 in) wide are also ornamental and the mature tree forms a round canopy. It is common along the Himalayan Lowlands, between Kashmir and Western Nepal at elevations between 900 and 3,000 metres. In the British Isles it is popular in many parks and estates where it was introduced in the mid-19th century. It is also found in many parts of the US.

It is also used as fiber reinforcements for composite fiberglass, rubber, and concrete products. Like other agaves, the pith of the leaves can be fermented and distilled to make mezcal. Sisal has an uncertain native origin, but is thought to have originated in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Sisal plants have a lifespan of 7–10 years, producing 200–250 usable leaves containing fibers used in various applications. Sisal is a tropical and subtropical plant, thriving in temperatures above 25 °C (77 °F) and sunshine. Historically, sisal was used by the Aztecs and Maya for a crude fabric. It spread to other parts of the world in the 19th century, with Brazil becoming the major producer. Sisal is propagated using bulbils or suckers and can be improved genetically through tissue culture. Fibers are extracted through decortication and then dried, brushed, and baled for export. Sisal farming initially led to environmental degradation, but it is now considered less damaging than other farming types. It is an invasive species in Hawaii and Florida. Global sisal production in 2020 was 210,000 tons, "

It is native to northeast, central China, and Taiwan. Unlike other members of the genus Ailanthus, it is found in temperate climates rather than the tropics. The tree grows rapidly, and is capable of reaching heights of 15 metres (50 ft) in 25 years. While the species rarely lives more than 50 years, some specimens exceed 100 years of age. It is considered a noxious weed and vigorous invasive species, and one of the worst invasive plant species in Europe and North America. In 21st-century North America, the invasiveness of the species has been compounded by its role in the life cycle of the also destructive and invasive spotted lanternfly.Ailanthus altissima is a medium-sized tree that reaches heights between 17 and 27 m (60 and 90 ft) with a diameter at breast height of about 1 m (3 ft). The bark is smooth and light grey, often becoming somewhat rougher with light tan fissures as the tree ages. The twigs are stout, smooth to lightly pubescent, and reddish or chestnut in color.

The juice of the leaves and fresh bark is used as a remedy for after-pains. The tree is also used in matchstick industry, as fodder for goats, and is one of the best tree used to trap Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM).== References =="

Inappropriate extraction methods were resulting in trees dying, thus by the 1990s the Indian forestry department had banned extraction.Ailanthus triphysa occurs in India, including the Andaman Islands; Sri Lanka; Myanmar; South-Central and Southeast China; Thailand; Laos; Malaysia, including Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah; Cambodia; Vietnam; Philippines; Jawa, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Maluku in Indonesia; and Australia. In Australia, Ailanthus triphysa occurs as two isolated populations in Western Australia (at Prince Regent River and on the offshore Coronation Island, in the Kimberley), and from Cape York in Queensland and as far south as the Susan Island Nature Reserve at Clarence River (New South Wales). Ailanthus triphysa is a medium to tall evergreen tree growing up to 30 m and a trunk diameter of 1.2 m. The trunk is not buttressed, but rather straight and cylindrical. The bark is grey, somewhat rough and resembling sandpaper to the touch. The stems are lenticellate; they are blaze yellow with red speckles. The leaves are pinnate, curved and sickle-shaped drawn out to a point and are particularly oblique at the base. Venation is prominent, the net veins more obvious under the "

The type species for Alangium is Alangium decapetalum, which is now treated as a subspecies of Alangium salviifolium. All of the species are shrubs or small trees, except the liana Alangium kwangsiense. A. chinense, A. platanifolium, and A. salviifolium are known in cultivation.The genus consists of small trees, shrubs and lianas, and is native to western Africa, Madagascar, southern and eastern Asia (China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines), tropical Australia, the western Pacific Ocean islands, and New Caledonia. Most of the species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of east and southeast Asia. Five of the species extend well outside of this area. Alangium platanifolium extends from east Asia into Russia. Alangium chinense (sensu lato) extends from southeast Asia to Africa. Alangium salviifolium is the most widespread species, ranging from Africa to Australia, Fiji, and New Caledonia. Alangium villosum occurs from southeast Asia to Australia and the western Pacific Islands. Alangium grisolleoides is endemic to Madagascar and gives the genus a disjunct distribution.

The latter name is a play on the sound the seeds make as they rattle inside the pods. Siris is also a common name of the genus Albizia.It is a tree growing to a height of 18–30 m (59–98 ft) tall with a trunk .5 to 1 m (1 ft 8 in to 3 ft 3 in) in diameter. The leaves are bipinnate, 7.5–15 cm (3–6 in) long, with one to four pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 6–18 leaflets. The flowers are white, with numerous 2.5–3.8 cm (1.0–1.5 in) long stamens, and very fragrant. The fruit is a pod 15–30 cm (6–12 in) long and 2.5–5.0 cm (1–2 in) broad, containing six to twelve seeds. Albizia lebbeck is found in a wide range of climates. The variety can be semi-desert, to humid regions. It can last in long cold winters, as well as very dry climate. A. lebbeck is a drought-tolerant tree that can be found throughout the tropics. This plant is native to Asia and is a very invasive species. Due to its ability to adapt to a broad spectrum of climates, this species has become very invasive. It has spread to different tropical regions throughout the world as invasive species.

This plant is cited in Flora Brasiliensis by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. It does not twine, nor does it have tendrils or aerial roots. It can be pruned into a shrub form. If not pruned it can sprawl to a height of 6 m (20 ft). According to McMullen, it can be up to 15 m (49 ft) in length in the Galapagos Islands where it is naturalised.

    "knowledge_text": "Alnus nitida, the west Himalayan alder, is a species in the genus Alnus, native to Pakistan, the western Himalayas, and Nepal. It is a tree reaching 20 to 25 m, preferring to live along the banks of rivers. It is used locally for timber and firewood, and as a street tree. The bark is used in some places for tanning and dyeing purposes. It grows well in heavy, clay soils and tolerates infertile soils. The leaves are thin, oval to ovate, 3-6 inches long and 2-3 inches wide. Female flowers appear first, followed by male catkinss in September to October, which may be up to 19 cm long. The fruits are woody cones, typically 2.5-3.5 cm long. This tree may be attacked by the apple stem borer (Trirachys holosericeus). In some places, the bark is used as an anti-inflammatory. One study examined its chemical components and concluded it has antioxidant potential. == References =="

In Australia it is known as the cunjevoi (a term which also refers to a marine animal).The giant taro was originally domesticated in the Philippines, but are known from wild specimens to early Austronesians in Taiwan. From the Philippines, they spread outwards to the rest of Maritime Southeast Asia and eastward to Oceania where it became one of the staple crops of Pacific Islanders. They are one of the four main species of aroids (taros) cultivated by Austronesians primarily as a source of starch, the others being Amorphophallus paeoniifolius, Colocasia esculenta, and Cyrtosperma merkusii, each with multiple cultivated varieties. Their leaves and stems are also edible if cooked thoroughly, though this is rarely done for giant taro as it contains higher amounts of raphides which cause itching. The reconstructed word for giant taro in Proto-Austronesian is *biRaq, which became Proto-Oceanic *piRaq.

It is cultivated for commercial products, mainly as a topical treatment used over centuries. The species is considered attractive for decorative purposes, and is often used indoors as a potted plant. The leaves of Aloe vera contain significant amounts of the polysaccharide gel acemannan, which can be used for topical purposes. The leaves also contain aloin, which is a toxic compound. Aloe vera products are typically made from the gel. Aloe vera acemannan may be used in skin lotions, cosmetics, ointments and gels for minor burns, skin abrasions, insect bites, and windburn. Oral ingestion of aloe vera extracts may cause acute abdominal pain and cramps, and hepatitis if consumed chronically. It should not be used during pregnancy. Some people have allergic reactions to aloe when used on skin.The genus name Aloe is derived from the Arabic word alloeh, meaning \"bitter and shiny substance\" or from Hebrew אוהלים ahalim, plural of אוהל ahal.

The 8-centimetre-long (3 in), glossy, pointed leaves are slightly rough to the touch and emit a strong lemon scent when bruised (hence the Latin specific epithet citrodora—lemon-scented). Sprays of tiny purple or white flowers appear in late spring or early summer, although potted lemon verbenas may not flower. It is evergreen in tropical locations, but is sensitive to cold, losing leaves at temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F), although the wood is hardy to −10 °C (14 °F). Pruning is recommended in spring to encourage a bushy form. Due to its many culinary uses, it is widely listed and marketed as a plant for the herb garden.

It frequently self-sows, which may create a perception that the plants are perennial. The plant may flower during its first year when sown early. It will grow in a wide range of soils, and can easily reach a height of 8 ft (2.4 m) The flowers are in a range of colours from white to dark red, including pink, yellow and orange. Different colours prefer different soils. The darker red variety seems to favour sandy soils, while the lighter colour seems to favour clay soils. The plants are easily grown from seed, and readily self-seed. However, tender plants, whether young from seed or from old stock, may be wiped out by slugs and snails. The foliage is subject to attack from rust (fungus), which may be treated with fungicides. Commercial growers have reported that some closely related species (Alcea rugosa and Alcea ficifolia) are resistant to this fungus.

While to the Aymara people, who are native to the Andes and Altiplano regions of South America, A. caudatus is known as qamasa. Many parts of the plant, including the leaves and seeds, are edible, and are frequently used as a source of food in India as well as in South America, where it is the most important Andean species of Amaranthus, known as kiwicha. (See also amaranth seed and Andean ancient plants.) This species, as with many other amaranths, is originally from the American tropics. The exact origin is unknown, as A. caudatus is believed to be a wild Amaranthus hybridus aggregate. In indigenous agriculture, A. cruentus is the Central American counterpart to South American A. caudatus. A. caudatus is most recognizable for its striking flowering panicles that can reach up to 90 cm long. The colour of these highly dense flowering panicles ranges from black, to red and more commonly white. The red varieties of A. caudatus are due to a high content of betacyanins.

Because of its production potential and popularity as a vegetable in various cuisines, it can be raised as a cash crop.The elephant foot yam is used as food in Island Southeast Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, South Asia, New Guinea, Oceania, and Madagascar. Its origin and center of domestication was formerly considered to be India, where it is most widely utilized as a food resource. But a genetic study in 2017 has shown that Indian populations of elephant foot yams have lower genetic diversity than those in Island Southeast Asia, therefore it is now believed that elephant foot yams originated from Island Southeast Asia and spread westwards into Thailand and India, resulting in three independent domestication events. From Island Southeast Asia, they were also spread even further west into Madagascar, and eastwards to coastal New Guinea and Oceania by the Austronesian migrations, though they may have spread south into Australia without human intervention.

The dwarf cultivars, growing up to 6 m (20 ft), are the most profitable, maturing sooner and producing greater yields. In 2023, 3.9 million tons of cashew nuts were harvested globally, led by the Ivory Coast and India. The nut is edible and is eaten on its own as a snack, used in recipes, or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter. The cashew apple, an accessory fruit, is a light reddish to yellow fruit, the pulp and juice of which can be processed into a sweet, astringent fruit drink or fermented and distilled into liquor. Additionally, derivatives from the shell are used in products such as varnishes, lubricant, and paints.The cashew tree is large and evergreen, growing to 14 metres (46 feet) tall, with a short, often irregularly shaped trunk. The leaves are spirally arranged, leathery textured, elliptic to obovate, 4–22 centimetres (1+1⁄2–8+3⁄4 inches) long and 2–15 cm (3⁄4–6 in) broad, with smooth margins. The flowers are produced in a panicle or corymb up to 26 cm (10 in) long; each flower is small, pale green at first, then turning reddish, with five slender, acute petals 7–15 millimeters (1⁄4–5⁄8 in) long.

The native range of the species is Europe and Western Asia and North Africa. The species has been distributed widely by humans, either deliberately as an ornamental flower or accidentally. L. arvensis is now naturalised almost worldwide, with a range that encompasses the Americas, Central and East Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Malesia, the Pacific Islands, Australasia and Southern Africa. This common European plant is generally considered a weed and is an indicator of light soils, though it grows opportunistically in clay soils as well.

The flower serves as the emblem of the fictional hero the Scarlet Pimpernel.When found as a summer annual, the scarlet pimpernel has a low-growing creeping habit, but as a winter annual, it forms a half-rosette with an upright stem.

The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple plant to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations. The fruit, particularly its juice, has diverse uses in cuisines and desserts. Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit. The plant normally propagates from the offset produced at the top of the fruit or from a side shoot, and typically matures within a year.The words, pine apple, first referred to the cone (fruit) of the pine tree in the 14th century. This name convention occurred because medieval botanists called any unfamiliar tree fruit an apple if it had a firm, round shape. The generic name, pineapple, derived from a language of the indigenous people of Brazil, and by Gonzalo Hernandez Oviedo who described the piñas or pomme de pin (apple of pine) in Hispaniola around 1540. The first reference in English to the pineapple fruit was the 1568 translation from the French of André Thevet's The New Found World, or Antarctike where he refers to a Hoyriri, a fruit cultivated and eaten by the Tupinambá people, living near modern Rio de Janeiro, and now believ"

There is one species native to North America that is fairly well known and popular in cultivation, namely the western pearly everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea). The name probably derives from the common practice of drying the flowers and stems for decorations through winter months. This plant was used extensively by Native Americans for a variety of medicinal purposes. Two of the species, A. javanica and A. longifolia can be found on mountainsides on the Island of Java in Indonesia.

The species originated and was domesticated in Sudan. Native to Africa and the Indian subcontinent, it is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its grain. It is the world's fifth-most important cereal crop. The grain is used as food by humans, while the plant is used for animal feed and ethanol production.Sorghum is a large stout grass that grows up to 2.4 metres (8 ft) tall. It has large bushy flowerheads or panicles that provide an edible starchy grain with up to 3,000 seeds in each flowerhead. It grows in warm climates worldwide for food and forage. Sorghum is native to Africa and to the Indian Subcontinent, with many cultivated forms. Most production uses annual cultivars, but some wild species of Sorghum are perennial; the Land Institute is attempting to develop a perennial cultivar for \"repeated, sufficient grain harvests without resowing\". The name sorghum derives from Italian sorgo, which in turn most likely comes from 12th century Medieval Latin surgum or suricum. This in turn may be from Latin syricum, meaning \"[grass] of Syria\".

The soursop is adapted to areas of high humidity and relatively warm winters; temperatures below 5 °C (41 °F) will cause damage to leaves and small branches, and temperatures below 3 °C (37 °F) can be fatal. The fruit becomes dry and is no longer good for concentrate. With an aroma similar to pineapple, the flavor of the fruit has been described as a combination of strawberries and apple with sour citrus flavor notes, contrasting with an underlying thick creamy texture reminiscent of banana. Soursop is widely promoted (sometimes as graviola) as an alternative cancer treatment, but there is not enough reliable medical evidence that it is effective for treating cancer or any disease. Soursop leaves, skin, flesh, and seeds contain annonacin, a compound under preliminary research for its potential neurotoxicity.Annona muricata is a species of the genus Annona of the custard apple tree family, Annonaceae, which has edible fruit. The fruit is usually called soursop due to its slightly acidic taste when ripe.

Other English common names include ox heart and bullock's heart. The fruit is sweet and useful in preparation of desserts, but is generally less popular for eating than that of A. cherimola.It is a small deciduous or semi-evergreen tree reaching 8–10 metres (26–33 ft) tall with an open, irregular crown. The slender leaves are hairless, straight and pointed at the apex (in some varieties wrinkled), 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long and 2–7 cm (1–3 in) wide. The yellow-green flowers are generally in clusters of three or four 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) diameter, with three long outer petals and three very small inner ones. Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads. The fruits vary in shape, heart-shaped, spherical, oblong or irregular. The size ranges from 7–12 cm (3–4+1⁄2 in), depending on the cultivar. When ripe, the exterior of the fruit is brown or yellowish, with red highlights and a varying degree of reticulation, depending again on the variety. The flesh, which is white and pink with numerous black seeds, varies from juicy and very aromatic to hard with a repulsive taste.

Annona squamosa is semi-(or late) deciduous, and 3 to 8 metres (10 to 26 feet) tall, similar to soursop (Annona muricata). It is a native of tropical climate in the Americas, and Spanish traders aboard the Manila galleons docking in the Philippines brought it to Asia. The fruit is spherical-conical, 5–10 centimetres (2–4 inches) in diameter and 6–10 cm (2+1⁄4–4 in) long, and weighing 100–240 grams (3.5–8.5 ounces), with a thick rind composed of knobby segments. The colour is typically pale green through blue-green, with a deep pink blush in certain varieties, and typically has a bloom. It is unique among Annona fruits in being segmented; the segments tend to separate when ripe, exposing the innards. The flesh is fragrant and sweet, creamy white through light yellow, and resembles and tastes like custard. The seeds are coated with the flesh, It is found adhering to 13-to-16-millimetre-long (1⁄2 to 5⁄8 in) seeds forming individual segments arranged in a single layer around a conical core.

It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture fines herbes.The name chervil is from Anglo-Norman, from Latin chaerephylla or choerephyllum, meaning \"leaves of joy\"; the Latin is formed, as from an Ancient Greek word χαιρέφυλλον (chairephyllon).

The fruit is about 1 cm long, oblong-ovoid with a slender, ridged beak. A member of the Apiaceae, the native distribution of chervil is uncertain due to its long history of cultivation, particularly by the Romans; the New Oxford Book of Food Plants limits its native range to the Caucasus, while the Plants of the World Online cites it with a wider native range across central and southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia from Switzerland in the west, to Iran in the east.

    "knowledge_text": "Antiaris is a genus in the mulberry and fig family Moraceae. It is a monotypic genus, i.e. it contains only one species, namely Antiaris toxicaria. The genus was at one time considered to consist of several species, but is now regarded as just one variable species which can be further divided into five subspecies. One significant difference within the species is that the size of the fruit decreases as one travels from Africa to Polynesia. Antiaris has a remarkably wide distribution in tropical regions, occurring in Australia, tropical Asia, tropical Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Tonga, and various other tropical islands. Its seeds are spread by various birds and bats, and it is not clear how many of the populations are essentially invasive. The species is of interest as a source of wood, bark cloth, and pharmacological or toxic substances.The generic epithet Antiaris is derived directly from the Javanese name for it: ancar (obsolete Dutch-era spelling: antjar). Some of the better known synonyms include: Antiaris africana, Antiaris macrophylla and Antiaris welwitschii. In English it may be called bark cloth tree, antiaris, false iroko, false mvule or upas tree, and in the Javanese language it is known as the upas (meaning 'poison' in Javanese) or ancar. In the Indonesian language it is known as bemu. In the related official language of the Philippines, Filipino, upas, and in Malaysia's Malaysian language as ipoh or ancar. In Cambodia, it's called choer banh or choer chhâ"

It is also known more ambiguously as Chinese laurel, Queensland cherry, salamander tree, wild cherry, and currant tree.It is a variable plant which may be short and shrubby or tall and erect, approaching 30 metres (98 feet) in height. It has large oval-shaped leathery evergreen leaves up to about 20 centimetres (8 inches) long and 7 cm (3 in) wide. They are attached to the twigs of the tree with short petioles, creating a dense canopy. The species is dioecious, with male and female flowers growing on separate trees. The flowers have a strong, somewhat unpleasant scent. The staminate flowers are arranged in small bunches and the pistillate flowers grow on long racemes which will become the long strands of fruit. The fruits are spherical and just under 1 cm (1⁄2 in) wide, hanging singly or paired in long, heavy bunches. They are white when immature and gradually turn red, then black. Each bunch of fruits ripens unevenly, so the fruits in a bunch are all different colors. The skin of the fruit has red juice, while the white pulp has colorless juice. The fruit contains a light-colored seed. The fruit has a sour taste similar to that of the cranberry when immature, and a tart but sweet taste"

The current wild range of A. vulgaris includes its native range in Europe as well as introduced populations in Asia, Oceania, North America (where it has become naturalized), and South America. The wild form of A. vulgaris can grow flowering stems that 90 cm (35 in) tall from and often form a bushy clump at its base. In their native range, the species blooms from May to June. The flowers, with diameters measuring up to 60 mm (2.4 in) across, are typically blue or purple and possess petals with structures known as nectar spurs. Associated with fertility goddesses in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, archeological evidence suggests A. vulgaris was in cultivation by the 2nd century AD in Roman Britain. The species represented virtuous behaviour, the Holy Spirit, and the Trinity within Christian art; in other contexts, such as William Shakespeare's Hamlet, A. vulgaris was a malevolent symbol. While it has been treated as an herbal remedy since the Middle Ages, some chemicals within the plant are toxic to humans.

It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics by small and large commercial producers, both as a grain legume and as an oil crop. Geocarpy is atypical among legumes, which led botanist Carl Linnaeus to name the species hypogaea, from Greek 'under the earth'. The peanut belongs to the botanical family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae), commonly known as the legume, bean, or pea family. Like most other legumes, peanuts harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules, which improve soil fertility, making them valuable in crop rotations. Despite not meeting the botanical definition of a nut as \"a fruit whose ovary wall becomes hard at maturity\", peanuts are usually categorized as nuts for culinary purposes and in common English. Some people are allergic to peanuts and can have a potentially fatal reaction; this is distinct from tree nut allergies. Peanuts are similar in taste and nutritional profile to tree nuts such as walnuts and almonds, and, as a culinary nut, are often served in similar ways in Western cuisines.The peanut is an annual herbaceous plant growing 30 to 50 centimetres (12 to 20 in) tall.

The capitula are surrounded by an involucre made out of many bracts, each curving to form a hook, allowing the mature fruits to be carried long distances. The fruits are long, compressed achenes with short pappus hairs. Burdock roots contain mucilage, sulfurous acetylene compounds, polyacetylenes and bitter guaianolide-type constituents.

The fruit is subglobose, 7 cm (3 in) diameter, green maturing black. The palm is remarkable in two ways; first it is fast growing. One at the conservatory of the New York Botanic Garden grew to a height of 27 m (89 ft) in 25 years. Secondly it has very long pseudo-spines which look dangerous, but are not; possibly an example of Batesian mimicry. A. pinnata suffers from the red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, and is one of its major hosts in China. It is not a threatened species, though it is locally rare in some parts of its range. It serves as an important part of the diet of several endangered species, including cloud rats of the genus Phloeomys.

An extremely hardy pioneer plant, it is tolerant of drought and poor soil, often being the only cover on new road cuttings or verges. It has bright yellow latex. It is poisonous to grazing animals, and it is rarely eaten, but it has been used medicinally by many peoples, including those in its native area, as well as the indigenous peoples of the western United States, parts of Mexico, and many parts of India. In India, during the colorful festival Holika Dahan, adults and children worship by offering flowers, and this species is in its maximum flowering phase during March when the Holi festival is celebrated. It is also referred to as \"Kanteli Ka Phul\" and \"Satyanashi\" in India.Argemone mexicana seeds contain 22–36% of a pale yellow non-edible oil, called argemone oil or katkar oil, which contains the toxic alkaloids sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine. Four quaternary isoquinoline alkaloids, dehydrocorydalmine, jatrorrhizine, columbamine, and oxyberberine, have been isolated from the whole plant of Argemone mexicana.

Common names include Hawaiian baby woodrose, adhoguda अधोगुडा or vidhara विधारा (Sanskrit), elephant creeper and woolly morning glory. Its seeds are known for their powerful entheogenic properties, greater or similar to those of Ipomoea species, with users reporting significant psychedelic and spiritual experiences. The two botanical varieties are Argyreia nervosa var. nervosa described here, and Argyreia nervosa var. speciosa, the roots of which are used in Ayurvedic medicine. Argyreia nervosa contains various ergoline alkaloids such as ergine. A study reported stereoisomers of ergine to be found in the seeds at a concentration of 0.325% of dry weight. Two modern studies from a team of researchers also revealed lysergic acid, methylergometrine (syn. lysergic acid butanolamide), methysergide, lysergylalanine, and suspected, unidentifed ergopeptines. A study of the related Ipomoea tricolor showed that ergoline concentrations in the leaves are 12-fold lower than that of the seeds.While seeds of other Convolvulaceae, specifically Ipomoea corymbosa (ololiuhqui) and Ipomoea tricolor (tlitliltzin), were used in shamanic rituals of Latin America for centuries, A. nervosa was not traditionally used for this purpose.

Aristolochic acid is composed of an about 1:1 mixture of two forms, aristolochic acid I and aristolochic acid II. In addition to its carcinogenicity, aristolochic acid is also highly nephrotoxic and may be a causative agent in Balkan nephropathy.

Common names for various species in the genus include mugwort, wormwood, and sagebrush. Some botanists split the genus into several genera, but DNA analysis does not support the maintenance of the genera Crossostephium, Filifolium, Neopallasia, Seriphidium, and Sphaeromeria; three other segregate genera—Stilnolepis, Elachanthemum, and Kaschgaria—are maintained by this evidence. Occasionally, some of the species are called sages, causing confusion with the Salvia sages in the family Lamiaceae. Artemisia comprises hardy herbaceous plants and shrubs, which are known for the powerful chemical constituents in their essential oils. Artemisia species grow in temperate climates of both hemispheres, usually in dry or semiarid habitats. Notable species include A. vulgaris (common mugwort), A. tridentata (big sagebrush), A. annua (sagewort), A. absinthium (wormwood), A. dracunculus (tarragon), A. abrotanum (southernwood), and A. herba-alba (white wormwood). The leaves of many species are covered with white hairs. Most species have strong aromas and bitter tastes from terpenoids and sesquiterpene lactones, which discourage herbivory, and may have had a selective advantage. The small flowers are wind-pollinated. Artemisia species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species.The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The name "

A mature jackfruit tree produces some 200 fruits per year, with older trees bearing up to 500 fruits in a year. The jackfruit is a multiple fruit composed of hundreds to thousands of individual flowers; the fleshy petals of the unripe fruit are eaten by humans, in addition to the ripened fruit. The jackfruit tree is well-suited to tropical lowlands and is widely cultivated throughout tropical regions of the world, particularly from South Asia to Southeast Asia and Oceania. Its ripe fruit can be sweet depending on grown variety, which is commonly used in desserts. Canned green jackfruit has a mild taste and meat-like texture that lends itself to being called \"vegetable meat\". Jackfruit is commonly used in South and Southeast Asian cuisines. Both ripe and unripe fruits are consumed.

It has been widely planted and naturalised in the mild temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of both hemispheres, especially in the Mediterranean, California, the western Pacific and the Caribbean and is considered invasive in North America and Oceania. It forms dense stands on disturbed sites, sand dunes, in wetlands and riparian habitats.Arundo donax generally grows to 6 metres (20 ft) in height, or in ideal conditions can exceed 10 metres (33 ft). The hollow stems are 2 to 3 centimetres (0.79 to 1.18 in) in diameter.

The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems and are lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate shaped ending in acuminate or acute tips. Like other members of the genus, the sap is milky. The flowers are in cymes with 10-20 flowers each. They have purple or red corollas and corona lobes that are yellow or orange. Flowering occurs nearly year-round. The 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) long, fusiform shaped fruits are called follicles. The follicles contain tan to brown seeds that are ovate in shape and 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in) long. The flat seeds have silky hairs that allow the seeds to float on air currents when the pod-like follicles dehisce (split open).

It was botanically described in 1799. Because of its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus racemosus is constantly on the rise. Due to destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction, and deforestation, the plant is now considered \"endangered\" in its natural habitat.Asparagus racemosus is a climber having stems up to 4 m long. Its roots are both fibrous and tuberous. Shatavari has small pine-needle-like phylloclades (photosynthetic branches) that are uniform and shiny green. In July, it produces minute, white flowers on short, spiky stems, and in September it fruits, producing blackish-purple, globular berries. It has an adventitious root system with tuberous roots that measure about one metre in length, tapering at both ends, with roughly a hundred on each plant. Shatavari is used in Indian traditional medicine. Despite its long history of use in Ayurveda, no high-quality clinical evidence exists to support using shatavari as a therapy for any disease.

The leaves are simple and opposite. The fruit is an explosive capsule which starts out green in colour, but dries to brown after opening. A. g. gangetica, has larger (30–40 mm long) blue or mauve flowers. A. g. micrantha (Nees) Ensermu, has smaller (up to 25 mm long.) white flowers with purple markings on the lower lip. Widespread throughout the Old World Tropics, and introduced into tropical Americas and Hawaii, where it has become naturalized. Both subspecies of this plant have been introduced to Australia where A. g. micrantha is on the National Environmental Alert List and must be reported when found. The original range of the subspecies is unclear, but it is likely that A. g. gangetica was limited to Asia, and A. g. micrantha was limited to Africa. Ernest Akamine (1947) found that there were no apparent dormancy mechanisms operating in the seeds, which germinated freely 135 days after being expelled from parent plants. Flower production can begin as early as 40 days after germination, with seed development beginning after 57 days, facilitating the production of viable seed in as little as 72 days. The seeds are then expelled explosively "

There are varieties with red, white and green leaves. The flowers are small and obscure, greenish or reddish, corresponding to a degree with the color of the foliage of the plant. They can be male, female or hermaphrodite. The fruits are often overhanging because of their weight. The seeds retain their viability for three years. The yellow-brown seeds with a diameter of 3 to 4 millimeters and a more translucent seed shell are immediately germable. The black seeds with a diameter of only 1.5 to 2 millimeters and smooth, thick, leathery seed shell germinate only after two years.

It is also naturalised or introduced in some parts of Canada, North Africa and the United States. The foliage and berries are extremely toxic when ingested, containing tropane alkaloids. It can also be harmful to handle and/or touch these plants. These toxins include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, which cause delirium and hallucinations, and are also used as pharmaceutical anticholinergics. Tropane alkaloids are of common occurrence not only in the Old World tribes Hyoscyameae (to which the genus Atropa belongs) and Mandragoreae, but also in the New World tribe Datureae—all of which belong to the subfamily Solanoideae of the plant family Solanaceae. Consumption of Atropa bella-donna has unpredictable effects. The antidote for belladonna poisoning is physostigmine or pilocarpine, the same as for atropine.

A. fatua is a typical oat in appearance, a green grass with hollow, erect stems 1 to 4 feet (0.30 to 1.22 m) tall bearing nodding structures – panicles – of spikelets. The long dark green leaves are up to 1 centimetre (0.39 in) wide and rough due to small hairs. The seedlings are also hairy. The seed kernel is thinner, longer, darker and hairy when compared with the seed of the common cultivated oat (A. sativa). This species and other wild oats can become troublesome in prairie agriculture when it invades and lowers the quality of a field crop, or competes for resources with the crop plants.

    "knowledge_text": "The oat (Avena sativa), sometimes called the common oat, is a species of cereal grass (Avena) grown for fodder and for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural). Oats appear to have been domesticated as a secondary crop, as their seeds resembled those of other cereals closely enough for them to be included by early cultivators. Oats tolerate cold winters less well than cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye, but need less summer heat and more rain, making them important in areas such as Northwest Europe that have cool, wet summers. They can tolerate low-nutrient and acid soils. Oats grow thickly and vigorously, allowing them to outcompete many weeds, and compared to other cereals are relatively free from diseases. Oats are used for human consumption as oatmeal, including as steel cut oats or rolled oats. Global production is dominated by Canada and Russia; global trade is a small part of production, most of the grain being consumed within the producing countries. Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol and reduced risk of human heart disease when consumed regularly. One of the most common uses of oats is as livestock feed; the crop can also be grown as groundcover and ploughed in as a green manure.The oat is a tall stout grass, a member of the family Poaceae; it can grow to a height of 1.8 metres (5.9 ft). The leaves are long, narrow, and pointed, and grow upwards; they can be some 15 to 40 centimetres (5.9 to 15.7 in) in "

It is widely spread as an ornamental and weed, occurring in naturalised populations around the world. It used not only as an ornamental but also as a hedge and extensively as a component of folk medicines. As a weed it is regarded as problematic in many areas.A much-branched shrub up to 1.8m tall, the lower leaf axils have spines 1–2 cm in length, one of the specific features of this Barleria. The stem and branches are terete, smooth, lenticellate and glabrous. The leaves are elliptic to ovate (4-10.5 × 1.8-5.5 cm) with both surfaces pubescent when young but becoming glabrescent soon. The large golden-yellow flowers are clustered in the axils of the upper leaves and/or on bracts. Apically spinose calyx lobes and a yellowish to orange corolla are used to distinguish this species from other Barleria. In Zhōngguó/China, flowers appear October to December, while fruiting occurs from December to February, while in Pakistan there is all year flowering. The Australian flowering and fruiting times are trimodal, from March to June, August to October and December. The subspecies pubiflora (see Taxonomy, below) is separated from the nominate subspecies by having longer anthers (5mm or more) and corolla (4.5–7 cm) and larger leaves (up to 17 x 5.5 cm).

The plant is native to Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and New Guinea and naturalized elsewhere. It has a number of culinary uses.Basella alba is a fast-growing, soft-stemmed vine, reaching 10 metres (33 ft) in length. Its thick, semi-succulent, heart-shaped leaves have a mild flavour and mucilaginous texture. There are two varieties—green and red. The stem of the Basella alba is green with green leaves and the stem of the cultivar Basella alba 'Rubra' is reddish-purple; the leaves form green and as the plant reaches maturity, older leaves will develop a purple pigment starting at the base of the leaf and work towards the end. The stem when crushed usually emits a strong scent. Malabar spinach can be found at many Asian supermarkets, as well as farmers' markets. Basella alba grows well under full sunlight in hot, humid climates, and in areas lower than 500 metres (1,600 ft) above sea level. If grown in acceptable conditions, its peak-season growth can accelerate remarkably. Growth is slower in cooler temperatures; its growth will not be vigorous if daytime temperatures fall at or below 10–15 °C (50–59 °F), resulting in low yields. Given its natural ancestry of the Indian subcontinent, Malabar spinach is a true tropical plant, and has a natural preference for daytime temperatures between 21–32 °C"

It is native to Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and China.The tree's leaves are relatively small and wide, with dimensions ranging from 2 to 5 cm in length and 2.5 to 6.3 cm in width. A cleft divides each leaf into two rounded globes. The flowers appear in terminal racemes, measuring 5 to 12.5 cm in length. The pods are stalked, smooth, and turgid, featuring a blunt apex and a tapered base. Ripe pods exhibit a dark brown color, are indehiscent, and house 12 to 20 seeds. The bark is scabrous, displaying vertical cracks, and has a bluish-black hue. The tree blossoms between March and June, and its pods mature in November-December, persisting on the tree for several additional months. The immature seeds of the tree are consumed by the grizzled giant squirrel. In Hindu families it is customary to exchange leaves of the Aapta tree on the Hindu festive day of Dussehra. An act known as exchanging Gold—pointing to the special significance of the plant on that particular day. This is also why the tree is often referred to as Sonpatta (literal translation: leaves of gold). The leaves are used in the production of beedi, a thin Indian and Sri Lankan cigarillo.

It has large, rough leaves with a width between 10–30 centimetres (4–12 in) long. In early summer from June to September, golden yellow flowers form in the leaf axils. After they are pollinated, they bear obloid fruit 50–60 cm (20–24 in) long and 10–25 cm wide. They typically weigh 5–10 kg, with weights of up to 34.5 kg recorded.

It is also naturally found in the Nilgiri Mountains of southern India and in Sri Lanka.Berberis aristata is characterized by an erect spiny shrub, ranging between 2 and 3 m (6.6 and 9.8 ft) in height. It is a woody plant, with bark that appears yellow to brown from the outside and deep yellow from the inside. The bark is covered with three-branched thorns, which are modified leaves, and can be removed by hand in longitudinal strips. The leaves are arranged in tufts of five to eight and are approximately 4.9 cm (1.9 in) long and 1.8 cm (0.71 in) broad. The leaves are deep green on the dorsal surface and light green on the ventral surface. The leaves are simple with pinnate venation. The leaves are leathery in texture and are toothed, with several to many small indentations along the margin of the leaf. The flowering season begins in mid-March and lasts throughout the month of April. The yellow flowers that develop are complete and hermaphroditic. The average diameter of a fully opened flower is 12.5 mm (0.49 in). The flowers form a racemose inflorescence, with 11 to 16 flowers per raceme, arranged along a central stem.

Therefore, many species have two scientific names, one in Berberis, the other in Mahonia, each used by botanists on one side of the debate. A third generic name, Odostemon, can be found in older literature. It is considered by most authorities to be a rejected synonym for Mahonia.

Some of the most popular cultivar groups include: the sugar beet (used to produce table sugar), the root vegetable known as the beetroot or garden beet, the leaf vegetable known as chard or spinach beet or silverbeet, and mangelwurzel (a fodder crop).Beta vulgaris is a herbaceous biennial or, rarely, perennial plant up to 120 centimetres (4 ft) in height, rarely 200 cm; cultivated forms are mostly biennial. The roots of cultivated forms are dark red, white, or yellow and moderately to strongly swollen and fleshy (subsp. vulgaris); they are brown, fibrous, sometimes swollen, and woody in the wild subspecies. The stems grow erect or, in the wild forms, often procumbent; they are simple or branched in the upper part, and their surface is ribbed and striate. The basal leaves have a long petiole (which may be thickened and red, white, or yellow in some cultivars). The simple leaf blade is oblanceolate to heart-shaped, dark green to dark red, slightly fleshy, usually with a prominent midrib, with entire or undulate margin, 5–20 cm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants)."

Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica and is considered a delicacy.Ackee is an evergreen tree that grows about 10 metres tall, with a short trunk and a dense crown. The leaves are paripinnately, compound 15–30 centimetres (6–12 inches) long, with 6–10 elliptical to oblong leathery leaflets. Each leaflet is 8–12 cm (3–4+1⁄2 in) long and 5–8 cm (2–3 in) wide. The inflorescences are fragrant, up to 20 cm long, with unisexual flowers that bloom during warm months. Each flower has five greenish-white petals, which are fragrant. The fruit is pear-shaped and has three lobes (two to four lobes are common).

It grows to 2 metres tall, with alternately-arranged leaves 7–15 cm long and 6–12 cm broad, oval-acuminate with a serrated margin. Boehmeria nivea has been cultivated in China and elsewhere in southeast Asia for thousands of years, as the source of the fibre crop ramie. It has been introduced into tropical and subtropical parts of other continents, such the southeastern United States.Boehmeria nivea was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Urtica nivea. In 1830, Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupré transferred it to the genus Boehmeria, which had been established by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1760. The species has acquired a substantial number of synonyms, most in the genera Boehmeria and Urtica. Some varieties have been proposed but are not accepted: Boehmeria nivea var. tenacissima and Boehmeria nivea var. strigosa.  Media related to Boehmeria nivea at Wikimedia Commons"

This Asian tropical tree has a straight tall trunk and its leaves are deciduous in winter. Red flowers with 5 petals appear in the spring before the new foliage. It produces a capsule which, when ripe, contains white fibres like cotton. Its trunk bears spikes to deter attacks by animals. Although its stout trunk suggests that it is useful for timber, its wood is too soft to be very useful.Bombax ceiba grows to an average of 20 meters, with old trees up to 60 meters in wet tropical regions. The trunk and limb bear numerous conical spines particularly when young, but get eroded when older. The leaves are palmate with about 6 leaflets radiating from a central point (tip of petiole), an average of 7–10 centimetres (2+5⁄6–4 in) wide, 13–15 centimetres (5+1⁄6–5+5⁄6 in) in length.

The trunk is grey, robust, and ringed with leaf scars; old leaves remain attached to the trunk for several years before falling cleanly. The leaves are fan-shaped, and 3 m (9.8 ft) long, with robust black teeth on the petiole margins. Like all Borassus species, B. flabellifer is dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. But very rarely male and female flowers in same trees have also been noticed The male flowers are less than 1 centimetre (0.39 in) long and form semi-circular clusters, which are hidden beneath scale-like bracts within the catkin-like inflorescences. In contrast, the female flowers are golfball-sized and solitary, sitting upon the surface of the inflorescence axis. After pollination, these blooms develop into fleshy fruits 15–25 centimetres (5.9–9.8 in) wide, each containing 1-3 seeds. The fruits are black to brown with sweet, fibrous pulp, and each seed is enclosed within a woody endocarp.

It is the most widely distributed moonwort, growing throughout the Northern Hemisphere across Eurasia and from Alaska to Greenland, as well as temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere.This is a small plant growing up to 30 cm (12 in) in height from an underground caudex. The leaf is pinnate and is divided into a sterile frond and a fertile frond. The sterile frond of the leaf has 4 to 9 pairs of fan-shaped leaflets or pinnae. The fertile part of the leaf is very different in shape, with grapelike clusters of round sporangia producing spores by which it reproduces. As in other members of the family Ophioglossaceae, this species is eusporangiate, the sporangia derived from more than one initial cell and having sporangial walls more than one cell thick. Their spores develop into underground, mycotrophic gametophytes. Moonworts die down at the end of summer, frequently lying dormant for several seasons before re-appearing. The first formal species description of Botrychium lunaria was made by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Osmunda lunaria. Moonwort has a circumpolar distribution, being recorded in Eurasia, North America and Greenland. It also occurs in north Africa, the Himalayas, and temperate zones of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and South America. Although its distribution is patchy, and it may be locally rare, it is rated as of least concern in The IUCN "

Rattlesnake fern prefers to grow in rich, moist woods in dense shade and will not tolerate direct sunlight.It is a low growing species, typically being a foot high or smaller. The leaf emerges in the early spring and will senesce in late summer. The leaf is roughly triangularly shaped and 15–50 cm in size and held roughly parallel to the ground. The leaf is 3-4 times pinnately compound, brightly green colored, and feels soft to the touch. The stem is round and bicolor, being pinkish or light tan at the base but greenish nearer the branches or leaves. The diploid number is 184. Rattlesnake fern has separate fertile and sterile leaves, when present the sterile leaf arises halfway up the stalk and the fertile leaf exists at the tip. The spores are shed in late spring. Like other ferns rattlesnake fern undergoes alternation of generations and the form described in this article is the sporophyte. This fern has been used medicinally. In India it is still used to treat dysentery. The first formal species description of Botrypus virginianus was made by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Osmunda virginiana. Recent res"

Mustard greens are a moderate source of vitamin E and calcium. Greens are 92% water, 4.5% carbohydrates, 2.6% protein and 0.5% fat (table). The leaves, seeds, and stems of this mustard variety are edible. The plant appears in some form in African, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Filipino, Tripuri, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Okinawan, Nepali, Pakistani, Korean, Southern, Taiwanese, and African-American (soul food) cuisines. Cultivars of B. juncea are grown for their greens, and for the production of mustard oil. The mustard condiment made from the seeds of the B. juncea is called brown mustard and is considered to be spicier than yellow mustard. Because it may contain erucic acid, a potential toxin, mustard oil is restricted from import as a vegetable oil into the United States.

Later, the plant forms long, beaked seed pods, which contain rounded seeds. Despite their similar common names, black mustard and white mustard (genus Sinapis) are not in the same genus. Black mustard belongs to the same tribe as cabbage and turnips. R. nigrum also resembles Hirschfeldia incana (hoary mustard, formerly known as Brassica geniculata), a perennial plant.

    "knowledge_text": "Elwendia persica is a plant species in the family Apiaceae. It is related to cumin (Cuminum cyminum) and sometimes called black cumin, or black caraway, and has a smoky, earthy taste. It is often confused with Nigella sativa (which is also called black cumin, black caraway, or black seed), by which it is often substituted in cooking. Dried E. persica fruits are used as a culinary spice in northern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Iran. It is practically unknown outside these areas.Local names for that spice are kala zeera (काला ज़ीरा black cumin) in hindi, shahi zeera (শাহী জিরা, (शाहि ज़ीरा; imperial cumin) in Bengali and Hindi, as syah zirah (سیاہ زیرہ; black cumin), kaala zirah (کالا زیرہ; black cumin), and zirah kuhi (زيره كوهی; mountain/wild cumin) in Urdu, zireh kuhi (زيره كوهی; wild cumin) in Persian, and siyoh dona (сиёх дона; black seed) in Tajiki, and in Malayalam sahajīrakaṁ (സഹജീരകം). The commonly used Hindi term shahi zeera may be a distortion of syahi (black in Persian) zeera. However, in the Hindustani language, the term syahi also means \"inky black\". In Bengali, kalo zeera also means black cumin, but refers to Nigella, not E. persica. Nigella is widely used as a spice in Bengali food. The plant bears slender, elongate, ribbed fruits which are harvested once the plant has become very dry. Not more than 5 to 8 g can be plucked from each plant, contributing to their high price. The seeds are most valued as a garnish to high value, very sp"

It is also known as flame of the forest, Bengal kino, dhak, palash, and bastard teak. Revered as sacred by Hindus, it is prized for producing an abundance of vivid blooms, and it is also cultivated elsewhere as an ornamental. The plant grows across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and western Indonesia.Butea monosperma is a small-sized dry-season deciduous tree, growing to 15 m (49 ft) tall. It is slow-growing: young trees have a growth rate of a few feet per year. The leaves are pinnate, with an 8–16 cm (3.1–6.3 in) petiole and three leaflets. Each leaflet is 10–20 cm (3.9–7.9 in) long. The flowers are 2.5 cm (0.98 in) long, bright orange-red, and produced in racemes up to 15 cm (5.9 in) long. The fruit is a pod 15–20 cm (5.9–7.9 in) long and 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in) broad. The flowers frequently have a spectacular bloom sometime from February to April, although the trees do not flower every year. Each flower features five petals, two wings, and a keel that resembles the curled beak of a parrot. If the winter season is too cold, too dry, or too rainy, trees may not blossom. Historically, palash originated in Bihar and Jharkhand.

Centres of diversity occur in Cuba (about 30 species), China (17 species) and Madagascar (9 species). They are slow-growing evergreen shrubs and small trees, growing to 2–12 m (rarely 15 m) tall. The leaves are opposite, rounded to lanceolate, and leathery; they are small in most species, typically 1.5–5 cm long and 0.3–2.5 cm broad, but up to 11 cm long and 5 cm broad in B. macrocarpa. The flowers are small and yellow-green, monoecious with both sexes present on a plant. The fruit is a small capsule 0.5–1.5 cm long (to 3 cm in B. macrocarpa), containing several small seeds. The genus splits into three genetically distinct sections, each section in a different region, with the Eurasian species in one section, the African (except northwest Africa) and Madagascan species in the second, and the American species in the third. The African and American sections are genetically closer to each other than to the Eurasian section. The genomes of Buxus austro-yunnanensis and Buxus sinica have been sequenced.

The genus is distinguished by its tiny yet extraordinarily complex flowers. Species of Ayenia grow in diverse habitats, from open areas in dry and seasonally-dry regions to humid forests, river banks, and from lowlands to high elevations. Byttneria species are host plants to insects such as beetles of the genus Lonchophorellus. Ayenia, Byttneria, and Rayleya were formerly described as separate genera, with Ayenia having a Neotropical distribution, Byttneria as a Pantropical genus, and Rayleya as a monotypic genus with a single Brazilian species, Rayleya bahiensis. A phylogenetic analysis found that Byttneria was paraphyletic and Ayenia was nested within it, and Rayleya was a sister clade to the others. In 2018 Christenhusz and Byng transferred the Byttneria and Rayleya names to Ayenia, which had nomenclatural priority. 217 species are currently accepted.

In other environments it grows into a low dome shape with a clear sub canopy space. Leaves are bipinnate, with 5–10 pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 15–25 pairs of leaflets; the individual leaflets are 7 mm long and 2 mm broad. The fruit is a twisted pod 5 cm (2.0 in) long. The species was first described by Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin in 1763, as Poinciana coriaria. In 1799, Carl Ludwig Willdenow transferred it to the genus Caesalpinia, and in 1830, Diederich von Schlechtendal transferred it to his newly created genus Libidibia. The genus Libidibia was not always accepted and the species was usually placed in Caesalpinia, until molecular phylogenetic studies led to the reinstatement of Libidibia. Tannins are extracted from divi-divi pods for use in leather production. Among the molecules isolated is corilagin, whose name comes from the specific epithet of the plant.

    "knowledge_text": "Biancaea sappan is a species of flowering tree in the legume family, Fabaceae, that is native to tropical Asia. Common names in English include sappanwood and Indian redwood. It was previously ascribed to the genus Caesalpinia. Sappanwood is related to brazilwood (Paubrasilia echinata), and was itself called brasilwood in the Middle Ages. Biancaea sappan can be infected by twig dieback (Lasiodiplodia theobromae). This plant has many uses. It has antibacterial and anticoagulant properties. It also produces a valuable reddish dye called brazilin, used for dyeing fabric as well as making red paints and inks. Slivers of heartwood are used for making herbal drinking water in various regions, such as Kerala, Karnataka and Central Java, where it is usually mixed with ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. The heartwood also contains juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), which has antimicrobial activity. Homoisoflavonoids (sappanol, episappanol, 3'-deoxysappanol, 3'-O-methylsappanol, 3'-O-methylepisappanol and sappanone A) can also be found in B. sappan. The wood is somewhat lighter in color than brazilwood and other related trees. Sappanwood was a major trade good during the 17th century, when it was exported from Southeast Asian nations (especially Thailand) aboard red seal ships to Japan.

The pigeon pea is widely cultivated in tropical and semitropical regions around the world, being commonly consumed in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. The scientific name for the genus Cajanus and the species cajan derive from the Malay word katjang (modern spelling: kacang) meaning legume in reference to the bean of the plant. In English they are commonly referred to as pigeon pea which originates from the historical utilization of the pulse as pigeon fodder in Barbados. The term Congo pea and Angola pea developed due to the presence of its cultivation in Africa and the association of its utilization with those of African descent. The names no-eye pea and red gram both refer to the characteristics of the seed, with no-eye pea in reference to the lack of a hilum blotch on most varieties, unlike the black-eyed pea, and red gram in reference to the red color of most Indian varieties and gram simply referring to the plant being a legume.  In Cape Verde they make a soup with the dried pigeon peas called feijão Congo, after its own name, made with dried pigeon peas in a similar manner to Brazilian feijoada.

The basal section of the plant grows vertically for 10 metres or so, after which the slender, tough stem of a few centimetres in diameter, grows horizontally for 200 metres or more. It is extremely flexible and uniform in thickness, and frequently has sheaths and petioles armed with backward-facing spines which enable it to scramble over other plants. It has pinnate, alternate leaves, 60–80 cm long, armed with two rows of spines on the upper face. The plants are dioecious, and flowers are clustered in attractive inflorescences, enclosed by spiny spathes. The edible fruits are top-shaped, covered in shiny, reddish-brown imbricate scales, and exude an astringent red resin known medicinally and commercially as \"dragon's blood\". The canes are sought after and expensive, but have to a large extent been replaced by sticks made from plants, such as bamboos, rushes and osier willows.

Around 20% of rattan palm species are economically important and are traditionally used in Southeast Asia in producing wickerwork furniture, baskets, canes, woven mats, cordage, and other handicrafts. Rattan canes are one of the world's most valuable non-timber forest products. Some species of rattan also have edible scaly fruit and heart of palm. Despite increasing attempts in the last 30 years at commercial cultivation, almost all rattan products still come from wild-harvested plants. Rattan supplies are now rapidly threatened due to deforestation and overexploitation. Rattan were also historically known as Manila cane or Malacca cane, based on their trade origins, as well as numerous other trade names for individual species.Most rattan palms are classified ecologically as lianas because most mature rattan palms have a vine-like habit, scrambling through and over other vegetation.

The fruit is a berry, 2–5 mm diameter and pink to red-purple with a highly distinctive metallic lustre, are very conspicuous in clusters on the bare branches after the leaves fall. The berries last well into the winter or dry season and are an important survival food for birds and other animals, though they will not eat them until other sources are depleted. The berries are highly astringent but are made into wine and jelly. Callicarpa species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species in Asia including Endoclita malabaricus and Endoclita undulifer. American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana) is native to the southeastern United States. It can typically reach 1 to 2 meters in height. A jelly can be made from its ripe berries.

In Calotropis, gynostegium is present (formed by the fusion of stigma and androecium). The pollen are in a structure named pollinia which is attached to a glandular, adhesive disc at the stigmatic angle (translator mechanism). These sticky discs get attached to the legs of visiting bees that pull out pollinia when a bee moves away. When such a bee visits another flower, this flower might be pollinated by the pollinium.

Its green fruits contain a toxic milky sap that is extremely bitter and turns into a latex-like substance, which is resistant to soap. Common names for the plant include apple of Sodom, Sodom apple, roostertree, king's crown, small crownflower, giant milkweed, rubber bush, and rubber tree. The names \"Apple of Sodom\" and \"Dead Sea Apple\" stem from the ancient authors Josephus and Tacitus, who described the plant growing in the area of biblical Sodom. Although not native to the New World, the plant (and other related milkweed species) has been cultivated, and feeds monarch butterfly caterpillars, in places such as California, Hawaii and the island of Puerto Rico. In Arabic, it is known as al-ashkhar. Some biblical commentators believe that the ashkhar may have been the poisonous gourd (or poison-tasting gourd) that led to \"death in the pot\" in 2 Kings 4:38–41.

Assam's people tried to plant the Chinese varieties in Assam soil but did not succeed. Assam tea is now mostly grown at or near sea level and is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam tea, are often sold as \"breakfast\" teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves. The state of Assam is the world's largest tea-growing region by production, lying on either side of the Brahmaputra River, and bordering Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and very close to China. This part of India experiences high rainfall; during the monsoon period, as much as 250 to 300 mm (10 to 12 in) of rain falls per day. The daytime temperature rises to about 36 °C (96.8 °F), creating greenhouse-like conditions of extreme humidity and heat. This tropical climate contributes to Assam tea's unique malty taste, a feature for which this tea is well known. Though Assam generally denotes the distinctive black teas from Assam, the region produces smaller quantities of green and white teas as well, with their own distinctive characteristics. Historically, Assam has been the second commercial tea production region after southern China, the only two regions in the world with native tea plants. The introduction "

Kukicha (twig tea) is also made from C. sinensis, but uses twigs and stems rather than leaves.The name sinensis is a compound meaning \"from China\" in Botanical Latin. The two parts are sin from Latin meaning China and -ensis the suffix meaning place of origin. The generic name Camellia is taken from the Latinized name of Rev. Georg Kamel, SJ (1661–1706), a Moravian-born Jesuit lay brother, pharmacist, and missionary to the Philippines. Camellia sinensis is widely known by the common name tea tree, a name in use since 1760. However, it is also used to refer to shrubs or trees of the myrtle family from Australia and New Zealand, most frequently species in Leptospermum or Melaleuca the first usage dating to 1790.

The taxonomic status of the species is controversial and unsettled. Species within the genus Capparis are highly variable, and interspecific hybrids have been common throughout the evolutionary history of the genus. As a result, some authors have considered C. spinosa to be composed of multiple distinct species, others that the taxon is a single species with multiple varieties or subspecies, or that the taxon C. spinosa is a hybrid between C. orientalis and C. sicula. Capparis spinosa is native to almost all the circum-Mediterranean countries, and is included in the flora of most of them, but whether it is indigenous to this region is uncertain. The family Capparaceae could have originated in the tropics and later spread to the Mediterranean basin. The plant is best known for the edible flower buds (capers), used as a seasoning or garnish, and the fruit (caper berries), both of which are usually consumed salted or pickled. Other species of Capparis are also picked along with C. spinosa for their buds or fruits. Other parts of Capparis plants are used in the manufacture of medicines and cosmetics.The shrubby plant is many-branched, with alternate leaves, thick and shiny, round to ovate.

It has been described as a protocarnivore because its seeds contain mucilage, which traps nematodes. The plant is native to Eurasia but is naturalized and considered a common weed in many parts of the world, especially in colder climates. It has a number of culinary uses.Capsella bursa-pastoris is a ruderal and an annual or biennial plant. It grows from a rosette of lobed leaves at the base. From the base emerges a stem most often 10–50 cm (4–20 in) tall, but occasionally as much as 70 cm (28 in) or as little as 2 cm (3⁄4 in), which bears a few pointed leaves partly grasping the stem, each up to 6.5 cm (2+1⁄2 in) long. The flowers, which appear in any month of the year in the British Isles, are white and small, 2.5 mm (1⁄8 in) in diameter, with four petals and six stamens. They are borne in loose racemes, and produce flattened, two-chambered seed pods known as silicles, which are about 6 mm long and triangular to heart-shaped, each containing several seeds. Like a number of other plants in several plant families, its seeds contain a substance known as mucilage, a condition known as myxospermy. Recently, this has been demonstrated experimentally to perform the function of trapping nematodes, as a form of 'protocarnivory'. Capsella bursa-pastoris is closely related to the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana and is also used as a model organism, because "

The genus Capsicum has over 30 species but Capsicum annuum is the primary species in its genus, as it has been widely cultivated for human consumption for a substantial amount of time and has spread across the world. This species has many uses in culinary, medicine, self-defense, and ornamental applications.The genus name Capsicum derives from a Greek-based derivative of the Latin word capto, meaning 'to grasp, to seize', in reference to the heat or pungency of the species' fruit, although it has also been speculated to derive from the Latin word capsa, 'box', referring to the shape of the fruit in forms of the typical species. Although the species name annuum means 'annual' (from the Latin annus, 'year'), the plant is not an annual but is frost tender. In the absence of winter frosts it can survive several seasons and grow into a large, shrubby perennial herb. Common names including the word pepper stem from a misconception on the part of Europeans taking part in the Columbian exchange.

Papaya is also the name of its fruit. It was first domesticated in Mesoamerica, within modern-day southern Mexico and Central America. It is grown in several countries in regions with a tropical climate. In 2022, India produced 38% of the world's supply of papayas.The word papaya derives from the Caribbean Taíno \"paapaía\" and is also the name for the plant. Some etymologists argue that the word comes from the Mayan \"páapay-ya\", which means \"mottled sapote\". However, the most commonly accepted etymology is the Taíno one, although it is possible that both word origins are interrelated. The name papaw or pawpaw is used alternatively for the fruit only in some regions, that name generally referring to Asimina triloba, an unrelated tree and fruit. The papaya is a large herbaceous plant, usually with a single stem growing from 5 to 10 m (16 to 33 ft) tall, with spirally arranged leaves confined to the top of the trunk. The lower trunk is conspicuously scarred where leaves and fruit were borne. The leaves are large, 50–70 cm (20–28 in) in diameter, deeply palmately lobed, with seven lobes. All plant parts contain latex in articulated laticifers. Papayas are dioecious. The flowers are five-parted and highly dimorphic; the male flowers have the stamens fused to the petals.

It has a pale stem which may reach a meter in height, and rigid, pointed, very spiny leaves. The flower head has many long, sharp phyllaries that can be up to several centimeters long, and often bend backwards (recurved). The disc florets are bright yellow. One plant can produce many stems which mat together due to their spininess and form a small thicket. The fruit is an achene about half a centimeter long with many rigid pappus scales. In Australia the plant is commonly regarded as a pasture weed because it competes with desired plants such as pasture or crops, seeds and bracts become embedded in wool which results in lower returns to farmers, and dense infestations restrict stock access and are difficult to walk through. It is generally not considered a weed in much of Europe. Seed germination is stimulated by red light. This means that germination is most likely in areas with little vegetation or pasture cover, e.g. when an area has been overgrazed. Seeds also "

Each branch will usually have from one to five flower heads containing 15 to 20 seeds per head. Safflower is native to arid environments having seasonal rain. It grows a deep taproot which enables it to thrive in such environments.The word safflower is a borrowing from the Dutch, saffloer, German, safflor, and Old French, saffleur, having uncertain origin, though influenced by the words saffron and flower. The word was first used in English in the 16th century. An alternate common name is false saffron, indicating the resemblance of its flower petals to those of saffron.  Safflower is a fast growing, erect, winter/spring-growing annual herb, that resembles a thistle.

The flowers are in a raceme interior blossoms, big in size, coloured yellow that tends to brown. Its legume fruit are horned, broadly oblong, compressed and flat and contain about six seeds. When cultivated as medicinal herb, the plants are cut down semi-annually, dried in the sun, stripped and packed in palm-leaf bags. They are then sent on camels to Essouan and Darao, then down the Nile to Cairo or else to Red Sea ports. Trade in senna provides a significant source of income for the nomadic Ababda. Senna alexandrina is also known under the names Egyptian senna, Tinnevelly senna, East Indian senna or the French séné de la palthe. It received the names Alexandrian senna and Egypt"

In the traditional medicine of Eastern Asia, the seeds are called jué míng zǐ in Chinese (simplified: 决明子; traditional: 決明子), gyeolmyeongja in Korean, and ketsumeishi in Japanese.

Its leaves, seeds, and root are also used in folk medicine, primarily in Asia. It is believed to possess a laxative effect, as well as to be beneficial for the eyes. As a folk remedy, the seeds are often roasted, then boiled in water to produce sicklepod tea.

As of April 2023, S. socotrana was regarded as a synonym of Senna sophera, which has a very much wider distribution. == References =="

Senna tora (originally described by Linnaeus as Cassia tora) is a plant species in the family Fabaceae and the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Its name is derived from its Sinhala name tora (තෝර). It grows wild in most of the tropics and is considered a weed in many places. Its native range is in Central America. Its most common English name is sickle senna or sickle wild sensitive-plant. Other common names include sickle pod, tora, coffee pod and foetid cassia. It is often confused with Chinese senna or sickle pod, Senna obtusifolia.The taxonomic history of this plant is extremely confused, even by the standards of Senna and Cassia. S. tora and S. obtusifolia were for long and are often still held to be—and may eventually be verified as—a single species. Hence, taxa referring to either species were indiscriminately applied to both. Cassia boreensis Miq. Cassia borneensis Miq. Cassia gallinaria Collad. Cassia numilis Collad. Apparently a misprint for Cassia humilis, which would have been applied to this species in error as it is properly a synonym of Senna obtusifolia and Chamaecrista kunthiana, depending on the author.

It is found in coastal forests of warm tropical regions worldwide including the Americas, Indomalaya, Australasia, Polynesia and tropical Africa. It is an obligate parasite, meaning it cannot complete its life-cycle without another host plant. Research in Florida (in southeast United States) has found that love-vine inhibits gall wasps by attacking the galls (small growths on plants) that the wasps create for their young. Cassytha filiformis is a twining vine with yellow or orange to pale green hollow stems with a length between 3–8 metres long. The stems attach to host plants by growing shoots from the base of its root, they have haustoria that fold inside the hosts' phloem and xylem membranes to absorb water and nutrients. The young shoots are slightly thicker and slightly darker than the unrelated dodder, but otherwise remarkably similar. Leaves are reduced to scales about 1 mm long and can be seen near stem ends. Flowers are borne in spikes 1–2 cm long from short stalks or sometimes solitary. There are six curved inward tepals made of 3 outer oval ones 1 mm long and three inner ones 2.5 mm long. Each one has smooth (glabrous) and broad stamens with short pointy ends forming into a beak shape. Fruit is a round and green or whitish drupe about 7 mm in diameter.

Around 20 trees are recorded with diameters over 4 m (13 ft) including one 7.5 m (25 ft) in diameter at breast height. A famous ancient tree known as the Hundred Horse Chestnut in Sicily was historically recorded at 18 m (59 ft) in diameter (although it has split into multiple trunks above ground). The bark often has a net-shaped (retiform) pattern with deep furrows or fissures running spirally in both directions up the trunk. The trunk is mostly straight with branching starting at low heights. The oblong-lanceolate, boldly toothed leaves are 16–28 centimetres (6–11 inches) long and 5–9 cm (2–4 in) broad. The flowers of both sexes are borne in 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long, upright catkins, the male flowers in the upper part and female flowers in the lower part.

It was first described in 1829, and has been cultivated around the world.The black bean is a large evergreen tree growing up to 40 m (130 ft) tall, though commonly much smaller. The leaves are 15 cm (5.9 in) long and 6–7 cm (2.4–2.8 in) broad, pinnate, with 11-15 leaflets. The flowers are bicoloured red and yellow, 3–4 cm (1.2–1.6 in) long, produced in racemes 6 cm (2.4 in) long. The fruit is a cylindrical pod 12–20 cm (4.7–7.9 in) long and 4–6 cm (1.6–2.4 in) diameter, the interior divided by a spongy substance into one to five cells, each of which contains a large chestnut-like seed. This species was first described in 1829 by English botanist Allan Cunningham, in a publication by Scottish naturalist Robert Mudie titled The Picture of Australia. The genus name Castanospermum is derived from the Latin castanea 'chestnut', and Ancient Greek spérma 'seed', and is a reference to the similarity of the black bean seeds to chestnuts.

    "knowledge_text": "Celosia argentea var. cristata (formerly Celosia cristata), known as cockscomb, is the cristate or crested variety of the species Celosia argentea. It is likely native to India, where it was saved from extinction through cultivation because of its religious significance. Indian, Burmese, and Chinese gardeners have traditionally planted it near temples. The name cockscomb comes from the flower's appearance, which resembles the crest (comb) on a rooster (cock). The plants are resistant to most plant diseases, and can thrive both indoors and outdoors. However, they do best in sunny, well-drained locations, as the plant is susceptible to fungal diseases. Primarily cultivated as an ornamental plant, cockscomb is valued for its distinctive wavy, velvety inflorescence. The plant is often displayed indoors as decoration, and the flowers can be cut and dried for use in dry bouquets. The leaves and flowers are edible. They are often grown as food in India, Western Africa, and South America. The somatic chromosome number for the cristate variety is 2n = 36, while investigation of the typical species revealed a chromosome number of 2n = 72.Cockscombs are tropical annual plants. As an herbaceous plant, they lack woody stems, instead having a straight, unbranched stem. The elliptic leaves lanceolate, and can range in color from green to reddish-bronze with terminal inflorescences. The plant produces thick, flattened, velvety flower heads, which can also range in color. They grow well in bo"

It causes a white rot in various types of broadleaved trees, particularly beech (Fagus), but also Abies, Picea, Pinus, Quercus and Ulmus species. This bracket fungus, commonly known as the giant polypore or black-staining polypore, is often found in large clumps at the base of trees, although fruiting bodies are sometimes found some distance away from the trunk, parasitizing the roots. M. giganteus has a circumboreal distribution in the northern Hemisphere, and is widely distributed in Europe. In the field, it is recognizable by the large, multi-capped fruiting body, as well as its pore surface that quickly darkens black when bruised or injured.The basidiocarps consist of numerous rosette-like flattened fan-shaped pilei; they are typically 50–150 centimetres (20–59 in), rarely 250 centimetres (98 in) in diameter and 10–50 centimetres (3.9–19.7 in), rarely 90 centimetres (35 in) high. The individual caps, up to 10–50 centimetres (3.9–19.7 in), rarely 90 centimetres (35 in) in diameter and 1–5 centimetres (0.39–1.97 in) thick, arise from a common basal stem. The weight is 10–50 kilograms (22–110 lb), but the heaviest specimen can reach 90 kilograms (200 lb). The color of the cap surface is pale tan to dull chestnut brown in young specimens but darkens in age to become concentric zones (zonate) of various shades of brown.

The specific epithet comes from the name of the island of Timor, the locality of the type collection. The most notable characteristic of the tree is the strong excrement odour that it emits from the bark and sap, which pervades the surrounding forest. This is due to the presence of the malodorous organic compound skatole. In Thailand, it therefore known as kæ̂ng k̄hī̂ phrar̀wng or mị̂ chĕd tūd phrar̀wng (Thai: แก้งขี้พระร่วง, ไม้เช็ดตูดพระร่วง) which means 'wipe the bottom timber'. Thai legend has it that Phra Ruang (the legendary King of the Sukhothai dynasty) wiped his buttocks with it. In Sri Lanka the heartwood of the tree (known as gurenda, ගුරෙන්ද) is used as a traditional ayurvedic medicine against syphilis, chickenpox, and measles.Celtis timorensis is a large forest tree growing to 25 m in height. The wood and sap have a strong foetid smell that resembles excrement because of the presence of skatole. The oblate to oblong, strongly 3-veined leaves are 50–130 mm in length. Although the tree resembles Cinnamomum iners in its 3-veined leaves, it can easily be distinguished by its serrated leaf margins.

Seeds dispersal is through the attachment of burs to passing cars, animals and human clothes. The burs of the plant can be harmful to animals because it adheres to animal skin and may cause ulcers in mouths of animals. It is common in the Sahel savannas of Africa, south of the Sahara. According to a botanical criteria of geographer Robert Capot-Rey, the northern limit of Cenchrus biflorus defines the southern boundary of the Sahara. It is also found in India, where the seeds are used in Rajasthan and its Marwar region to make bread, either alone or mixed with bajra (millet). A traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known grain has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.

In a related study, C. minima eased allergic rhinitis by slowing the infiltration of eosinophils and the proliferation of mast cells. A comprehensive investigation of the GC-MS chemical profile of C. cunninghamii and its biological activity showed that this species' extract contains novel compounds that possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In 2012, Nylinder et al. published an estimation of the species tree phylogeny of the Australian/New Zealand genus Centipeda (Asteraceae) based on nucleotide sequence data. Centipeda racemosa (snuffweed) is the sister to remaining species, which is also the only consistently perennial representative in the genus.

The forked leaves are brittle and stiff to the touch in some species, softer in others. Roots are completely absent and are missing even in the embryonic stage, but sometimes they develop modified leaves with a rootlike appearance, which anchor the plant to the bottom. Stomata are not present on any species. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the male and female flowers on the same plant. In ponds it forms thick buds (turions) in the autumn, which sink to the bottom and give the impression that the plant has been killed by the frost; but come spring, these will grow back into the long stems, slowly filling up the pond.

The species is commonly referred to as queen of the night, night-blooming cereus (though these two terms are also used for other species), large-flowered cactus, sweet-scented cactus or vanilla cactus. The true species is extremely rare in cultivation. Most of the plants under this name belong to other species or hybrids. It is often confused with the genus Epiphyllum.Grandiflorus is Latin for 'large flowered'. When Carl Linnaeus described this cactus in 1753 it was the largest flowered species of cacti known. Paradoxically, its flowers are moderate in size compared with several other Selenicereus species. The first species to be brought into cultivation. Linnaeus described it in 1753, but it was known long before. Records from Hortus Kewensis gives that the species was grown at Royal Gardens at Hampton Court before 1700. There has been doubt about which plant was available to Linnaeus when he drew up his description, but this is solved and both the plates on this side show the authentic species. It is native throughout the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti), Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and a few other locations in South and Central America. It is found climbing on trees and on rocks at an altitude of 700 metres. It has extremely variable stems, especially in Jamaica, with slightly wavy to st"

The growth habit is columnar or multi-stemmed and the tree develops large buttress roots. The radiating anchor roots are sometimes exposed and may loop up in places. The bark is silvery-grey to orangish-brown, smooth with occasional pustular lenticels. The leaves are in opposite pairs, glossy yellowish-green above, obovate with entire margins, up to 6 cm (2.4 in) long and 3 cm (1.2 in) wide. The flowers are borne singly in the leaf axils; each has a long stalk and a short calyx tube, and parts in fives or sixes. The paired stamens are enclosed in the petals, which open explosively when disturbed. The ovoid fruits are up to 3 cm (1 in) long suspended from the shrunken calyx tube. Brown at first, they change colour as they mature and the hypocotyl emerges. The hypocotyl is long and slender, growing to about 35 cm (14 in) long, and is ribbed, a characteristic that distinguishes this mangrove from the smooth-fruited yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).

In pure form, ascaridole decomposes violently upon heating, but this is relatively weak in regards to energy release, since breaking the oxygen bond will not destroy the entire molecule.

Depending on species, most Chlorophytum mature at about 10–60 cm (3\"-12\") in height, growing out from a central rosette of long, slender leaves of around 15–75 cm (5\"-29\") in length. The plants tend to have thick, fleshy, tuberous roots, about 0.5-2 cm (0.17\"-0.75\") thick. The flowers are small and usually white, produced on sparse panicles up to 120 cm (47\") long. In certain species, such as C. comosum (the ubiquitous 'spider plant'), the plants are known to reproduce vegetatively by producing plantlets—baby plants connected by an \"umbilical\" stem, sprouting from the side of the main mother-plant. On the ground, or in a wild setting, this vegetative growth habit enables vast swathes of the plant to colonize a single area, as the plantlets develop small roots to eventually anchor into the soil and spread the mass further. In a home or garden setting, these plants are often grown in hanging pots, on plant stands, high shelves or other elevated surfaces.

It is cultivated and naturalized in East Asia and in scattered locations in North America. Glebionis coronaria is used as a leaf vegetable. English language common names include garland chrysanthemum, chrysanthemum greens, edible chrysanthemum, crowndaisy chrysanthemum, chop suey greens, crown daisy, and Japanese greens. Glebionis coronaria has been hybridized with related Argyranthemum species to create cultivars of garden marguerites.A leafy herb, the garland chrysanthemum is an annual plant. It has yellow ray florets grouped in small flower heads and aromatic, bipinnately lobed leaves. Its seeds are ribbed and winged cypselae. The vegetable grows very well in mild or slightly cold climates, but will go quickly into premature flowering in warm summer conditions. Seeds are sown in early spring and fall. \"The plant is rich in minerals and vitamins with potassium concentrations at 610 mg/100 g and carotene at 3.4 g/100 g in edible portions. In addition, the plant contains various antioxidants (in stem, leaf, and root tissues) that have potential long-term benefits for human health, although toxic (dioxin) properties have also been observed. Extracts from C. coronarium var. spatiosum have been shown to inhibit growth of Lactobacillus casei, a beneficial human intestinal bacterium.\" The plant's greens are used in many "

It is one of the earliest cultivated legumes, the oldest archaeological evidence of which was found in Syria. Chickpeas are high in protein. The chickpea is a key ingredient in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines, used in hummus, and, when soaked and coarsely ground with herbs and spices, then made into patties and fried, falafel. As an important part of Indian cuisine, it is used in salads, soups, stews, and curries. In 2023, India accounted for 75% of global chickpea production.Chickpeas have been cultivated for at least ten thousand years. Cultivation spread from the Fertile Crescent eastward toward South Asia and into Europe through the Balkans. Historical linguistics have found ancestral words relating to chickpeas in the prehistoric Proto-Indo-European language family that evolved into the Indo-European languages. The Proto-Indo-European roots *kek- and *k'ik'- that denoted both 'pea' and 'oat' appeared in the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe between 4,500 and 2,500 BCE.

Native to Europe, it has been introduced to the Americas and Australia. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber. Chicory is also grown as a forage crop for livestock.When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem. It can grow to 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall. The leaves are stalked, lanceolate and unlobed; they range from 7.5–32 centimetres (3–12+1⁄2 inches) in length (smallest near the top) and 2–8 cm (3⁄4–3+1⁄4 in) wide. The flower heads are 3–5 cm (1+1⁄4–2 in) wide, and usually light blue or lavender; it has also rarely been described as white or pink. Of the two rows of involucral bracts, the inner is longer and erect, the outer is shorter and spreading. It flowers from March until October. The seed has small scales at the tip. Substances which contribute to the plant's bitterness are primarily the two sesquiterpene lactones, lactucin and lactucopicrin. Other components are aesculetin, aesculin, cichoriin, umbelliferone, scopoletin, 6,7-dihydrocoumarin, and further sesquiterpene lactones and their glycosides. Around 1970,"

Laurophyll or lauroid leaves are characterized by a generous layer of wax, making them glossy in appearance, and narrow, pointed oval in shape with an 'apical mucro', or 'drip tip', which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing respiration from plant. Mostly, the plants present a distinct odor. Their alternate leaves are ovate-elliptic, with margins entire o"

The leaves are ovate-oblong in shape and 7–18 cm (3–7 in) long. The flowers, which are arranged in panicles, have a greenish color and a distinct odor. The fruit is a purple 1 cm (0.5 in) drupe containing a single seed. The old botanical synonym for the tree, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, is derived from Sri Lanka's former name, Ceylon. Sri Lanka still produces 80–90% of the world's supply of C. verum, which is also cultivated on a commercial scale in the Seychelles, Madagascar and Tanzania. On Borneo, Cinnamomum verum is cultivated at low elevations in Sarawak (Kuching District), Sabah (Keningau and Sandakan districts), and Kalimantan.

It resembles a common watermelon vine but bears small, hard fruits with a bitter pulp. The plant contains cytotoxic cucurbitacins and is thus unsafe to use as an herbal medicine. It originally bore the scientific name Colocynthis citrullus.The vine ranges from 2.4–3 metres (8–10 feet) in length. The roots are large, fleshy, and perennial, leading to a high survival rate due to the long tap root. The vine-like stems spread in all directions for a few meters looking for something over which to climb. If present, shrubs and herbs are preferred and climbed by means of auxiliary branching tendrils. Very similar to watermelon, the leaves are palmate and angular with three to seven divided lobes. The flowers are yellow and solitary in the axes of leaves and are borne by yellow-greenish peduncles. Each has a subcampanulated five-lobed corolla and a five-parted calyx.

The Key lime has thinner rind and is smaller, seedier, more acidic, and more aromatic than the Persian lime (Citrus × latifolia). It is valued for its characteristic flavor. The name comes from its association with the Florida Keys, where it is best known as the flavoring ingredient in Key lime pie.

It is native to Southeast Asia and has been spread by humans to many parts of the world. It is a cross between the pomelo, Citrus maxima, and the wild type mandarin orange, Citrus reticulata. The bitter orange is used to make essential oil, used in foods, drinks, and pharmaceuticals. The Seville orange is prized for making British orange marmalade.In some proposed systems, the species Citrus × aurantium includes not only the bitter orange proper, but all other hybrids between the pomelo and the wild type mandarin, namely the sweet orange, the grapefruit, and all cultivated mandarins. This article only deals with the bitter orange proper. The bitter orange, like many cultivated Citrus species, is a hybrid, in its case of the wild mandarin and pomelo. The bitter orange spread from Southeast Asia via India and Iran to the Islamic world as early as 700 AD in the Arab Agricultural Revolution. After the Columbian exchange, the pomelo was introduced to the New World, starting in Mexico by 1568.  The bitter orange has orange fruit with a distinctly bitter or sour taste. The tree has alternate simple leaves on long petioles; there are long thorns on the petiole. The trees require little care and may live for as long as 600 years. It grows in subtropical regions but can tolerate a brief frost. The bitter orange has many of the same pe"

It is an ancestor of several cultivated citrus species, including the bitter orange and the grapefruit. It is a natural, non-hybrid citrus fruit, native to Southeast Asia. Similar in taste to a sweet grapefruit, the pomelo is commonly eaten and used for festive occasions throughout Southeast and East Asia. As with the grapefruit, phytochemicals in the pomelo have the potential for drug interactions.The pomelo tree can be 5–15 meters (16–50 feet) tall, with a trunk, often rather crooked, that is 10–30 centimeters (4–12 inches) thick, and low-hanging, irregular branches. The petioles (leaf stalks) are distinctly winged. The leaves are alternate, ovate or elliptic in shape, and 5–20 cm (2–8 in) long; they are leathery and dull green above, hairy beneath. The flowers — single or in clusters — are fragrant and yellow-white in color. The fruit is large, 10–30 cm (4–12 in) in diameter, round or somewhat pear-shaped. Its weight varies by cultivar from 0.26–1.95 kilograms (0.6–4.3 pounds). It has a thicker rind than a grapefruit, and is divided into 11 to 18 segments. The flesh is less acidic than that of the grapefruit. The pomelo has at least sixty cultivars. The fruit generally contains a few, relatively large seeds, but some varieties have numerous seeds. The characteristics of pomelo vary widely across South Asia. The pomelo is native to Southeast Asia and all of Malay"

It is one of the original citrus fruits from which all other citrus types developed through natural hybrid speciation or artificial hybridization. Though citron cultivars take on a wide variety of physical forms, they are all closely related genetically. It is used in Asian and Mediterranean cuisine, traditional medicines, perfume, and religious rituals and offerings. Hybrids of citrons with other citrus are commercially more prominent, notably lemons and many limes.The fruit's name is derived from the Latin citrus, which is also the origin of the genus name. The binomial name Citrus medica derives from Media, the kingdom of the Medes, where it was believed to originate (but see \"Origin and distribution\" below). A source of confusion is that 'citron' in French and English are false friends, as the French word 'citron' refers to what in English is a lemon; whereas the French word for the citron is 'cédrat'. Into the 16th century, the English term citron included the lemon and perhaps the lime as well. Other languages that use variants of citron to refer to the lemon include Armenian, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, German, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Esperanto, Polish and the Scandinavian languages.

Orange blossom petals can also be made into a delicately citrus-scented counterpart to rosewater, known as \"orange blossom water\" or \"orange flower water\". It is a common ingredient in French and Middle Eastern cuisines, especially in desserts and baked goods. In some Middle Eastern countries, drops of orange flower water are added to disguise the unpleasant taste of hard water drawn from wells or stored in qullahs (traditional Egyptian water pitchers made of porous clay). In the United States, orange flower water is used to make orange blossom scones and marshmallows. In Spain, fallen blossoms are dried and used to make orange tea.

Both the sexes are similar and are mimics of the unpalatable common crow (Euploea core). The upper forewing has a small white spot at the end of the cell, a complete series of equal sized marginal white spots in regular row and a terminal series of spots decreasing in size towards the apex. The upper hindwing has a discal series of arrow shaped white spots. It also has a submarginal series of elongated white crescent shaped markings. There is a white fringe between the veins. The outer halves of wings have a dusting of yellowish brown scales. It is found in South India where it occurs in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa and Andhra Pradesh. The butterfly is uncommon but not known to be threatened. It was commonest in Wynaad and Coorg in the past and rarer towards the extremities of its range.

The genus name Clematis is from Ancient Greek κληματίς : clēmatís, (\"a climbing plant\") from κλήμα : klḗma – 'twig, sprout, tendril'. The genus is composed of mostly vigorous, woody, climbing vines / lianas. The woody stems are quite fragile until several years old. Leaves are opposite and divided into leaflets and leafstalks that twist and curl around supporting structures to anchor the plant as it climbs. Some species are shrubby, while others, like C. recta, are herbaceous perennial plants. The cool temperate species are deciduous, but many of the warmer climate species are evergreen. They grow best in cool, moist, well-drained soil in full sun. Clematis species are mainly found throughout the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, rarely in the tropics. C"

However, a recent DNA study failed to separate Cleome, Podandrogyne, and Polanisia from each other, so some taxonomists have abandoned the last two of these genera, treating them as part of Cleome sensu lato; in this case, Cleome contains about 275 species, the vast majority of the Cleomaceae. The genus contains species which show an evolutionary progression from C3 to C4 photosynthesis. This, combined with it being very close to the Brassicaceae with the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, makes it an ideal genus in which to study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Morphological differences that demonstrate the transition from C3 to C4 include C3 species having leaves with more veins and larger bundle sheath cells. Also, species such as Cleome gynandra produce proteins needed for C4 photosynthesis. Three species independently acquired the C4 pathway, while others are C3–C4 inter"

It is considered an invasive species and is widely distributed in warm and humid habitats across the Americas, Africa and Asia, and in Australia (where it is considered a native). It is commonly found during the rainy season. The crushed leaves have been investigated as a treatment for stored seeds of cowpea, to prevent weevil infestation. The leaves are used as external application to wounds and ulcers. The seeds are anthelmintic and carminative. The juice of the leaves is used as a remedy against discharge of pus from the ear. In a study comparing C. viscosa to standard antibiotics, it was proven to be effective at inhibiting microbial growth. This demonstrates its effectiveness as an antimicrobial agent in comparison to the antibiotic tetracycline. In northern India, the seeds (called Jakhya) are used as a culinary herb, mainly for tempering. in Australia, the Walmajarri people of the southern Kimberley call it Jirlpirringarni.Plants (10–)30–100(–160) cm.

The flowers are pink, violet or purple and have two lips. Each has four stamens, a long style and fused carpels. Wild basil occurs in suitable locations in most of Europe, western and central Asia, North America and North Africa. Its typical habitat is dry grassland and heathland, usually on limestone or chalky soils. Though its distribution is patchy it is widespread and not threatened in the UK. The leaves of wild basil are used as an aromatic herb in the preparation of food dishes and to make a herbal tea. They can also be used in the preparation of both a brown and a yellow dye.

This genus was named after the human clitoris, for the flowers bear a resemblance to the vulva. The first reference to the genus, which includes an illustration of the plant, was made in 1678 by Jakób Breyne, a Polish naturalist, who described it as Flos clitoridis ternatensibus, meaning 'Ternatean flower of the clitoris'. Many vernacular names of these flowers in different languages are similarly based on references to female external genitalia. Controversies existed in the past among botanists regarding the good taste of the naming of the genus. The analogy drew sharp criticism from botanists such as James Edward Smith in 1807, Amos Eaton in 1817, Michel Étienne Descourtilz in 1826, and Eaton and Wright in 1840. Some less explicit alternatives, like Vexillaria (Eaton 1817) and Nauchea (Descourtilz 1826), were proposed, but they failed to prosper, and the name Clitoria has survived to this day. As of June 2021, Plants of the World Online accepted the following species: These plants are native to tropical, subtropical and temperate areas of the world, ranging through the temperate and tropical Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula, Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, southern China, and Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

The leaves are fairly round, sometimes initially brownish, maturing to green and often with red veins. The leaves decompose slowly, turning red before withering. Whitish to greenish flowers are produced on long spikes. In late summer, the plant bears green fruit, about 2 cm (3⁄4 in) diameter, in large, grape-like clusters. The fruit ripens to purplish-red and contains a hard pit constituting most of its volume. The species is dioecious, with male and female flowers borne on separate plants. Cross-pollination is necessary for fruit to develop, aided by insects including honey bees. Male and female plants can be distinguished by the appearance of their flowers, as males usually show dead flower stalks. C. uvifera can be propagated by seeds and cuttings, but the seeds do not survive being stored. The first botanical names of the plant were assigned in 1696 by Hans Sloane, who called it Prunus maritima racemosa, \"maritime grape-cluster Prunus\", and Leonard Plukenet, who named it Uvifera littorea, \"grape-bearer of the shore\", both of which names reflect the European concept of \"sea-grape\", expressed in a number of languages by the explorers of the times.

    "knowledge_text": "Cochlospermum religiosum is a flowering plant from the tropical region of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is a small tree growing to a height of 7.5 m (25 ft) usually found in dry deciduous forests. The name religiosum derives from the fact that the flowers are used as temple offerings. It is also known as silk-cotton tree because the capsules containing the seeds have a fluffy cotton-like substance similar to kapok. Another common name is buttercup tree because its yellow and bright flowers look like large-sized buttercups. In Theravada Buddhism, this plant is said to have been used as the tree for achieving enlightenment, or Bodhi, by the nineteenth Buddha, who was named \"Siddhaththa\" (Sinhala script: \"සිද්ධත්ථ\"). The plant is known as කිණිහිරියා (Kinihiriyaa) in the Sinhala language, and කණිකාර (Kanikaara) in Sanskrit.  Media related to Cochlospermum religiosum at Wikimedia Commons"

Originally native to Central Indo-Pacific, they are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions. The coconut tree provides food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials. The inner flesh of the mature fruit forms a regular part of the diets of many people in the tropics and subtropics. Coconut endosperm contains a large quantity of a liquid, \"coconut water\". Mature coconuts can be processed for oil and coconut milk from the flesh, charcoal from the hard shell, and coir from the fibrous husk. Dried coconut flesh is called copra, and the oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and in soaps and cosmetics. Sweet coconut sap can be made into drinks or fermented into palm wine or coconut vinegar. The hard shells, fibrous husks and long pinnate leaves are used to make a products for furnishing and decoration. The coconut has cultural and religious significance for Austronesian peoples, appearing in their mythologies, songs, and oral traditions.

It is widely cultivated and has been introduced to many other countries.Codiaeum variegatum is an evergreen and monoecious tropical shrub growing to 3 m (9.8 ft) tall, with thick, somewhat \"leathery\" and shiny, alternately arranged leaves. The foliage may measure from 5.0–30 cm (2.0–11.8 in) long by 0.5–8.0 cm (0.20–3.15 in) broad. The shape of mature leaves may appear diamond- or teardrop-shaped, even violin-like or ruler-lanceolate, lanceolate, oblong, elliptical, ovate-inverted, ovate-spatulate. The species is known for its vivid coloration (especially in higher sunlight), displaying almost \"tie-dye\"-like patterns of green, yellow, and purple, in varying hues and intensity, depending on variety. The petiole has a length of 0.2 to 2.5 cm. Similarly to other euphorbs, the inflorescences are long racemes, 8–30 cm (3.1–11.8 in) long, with male and female flowers separated. Male flowers are white, with five small petals and 20–30 stamens. The pollens are oval in shape and about 52x32 microns in size. The female flowers are yellowish and lacking petals. The blooming period is usually in early autumn, depending on location. The inedible and toxic fruit (for most mammals) is a capsule measuring "

Coffee produced from the less acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up most of the remaining coffee production. The natural populations of Coffea arabica are restricted to the forests of South Ethiopia and Yemen.Wild plants grow between 9 and 12 m (30 and 39 ft) tall, and have an open branching system; the leaves are opposite, simple elliptic-ovate to oblong, 6–12 cm (2.5–4.5 in) long and 4–8 cm (1.5–3 in) broad, glossy dark green, with prominent veins and wavy margins. The flowers are white, 10–15 mm in diameter, and grow in axillary clusters of 2 to 9. The seeds are contained in a drupe (commonly called a \"cherry\") 10–15 mm in diameter, maturing bright red to purple and typically containing two seeds, often called coffee beans. Coffea arabica was first described scientifically by Antoine de Jussieu, who named it Jasminum arabicum after studying a specimen from the Botanic Gardens of Amsterdam. Linnaeus placed it in its own genus Coffea in 1737.

The wild variety, Coix lacryma-jobi var. lacryma-jobi, has hard-shelled pseudocarps—very hard, pearly white, oval structures used as beads for making prayer beads or rosaries, necklaces, and other objects. The cultivated variety Coix lacryma-jobi var. ma-yuen is harvested as a cereal crop, has a soft shell, and is used in traditional medicine in parts of Asia.Job's tears may also be referred to under different spellings (Job's-tears, Jobs-tears).

Common names in English include Indian borage, country borage, French thyme, Indian mint, Mexican mint, Cuban oregano, broad leaf thyme, soup mint, Spanish thyme. The species epithet, amboinicus refers to Ambon Island, in Indonesia. In 1747, 45 years after his death, a volume written by Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, including the plants he called Marrubium album Amboinicum, with the local name Daun hati hati. He had encountered them in Ambon and the Banda Islands, both cultivated in gardens and growing wild. In 1790, the Linnaean name Coleus amboinicus was published by João de Loureiro (1717–1791) who had encountered the plants in Cochinchina and parts of India.A member of the mint family Lamiaceae, Coleus amboinicus grows up to 1 m (3.3 ft) tall.

The relationship among the genera Coleus, Solenostemon and Plectranthus has been confused. Coleus and Solenostemon were sunk into Plectranthus, but recent phylogenetic analysis found Plectranthus to be paraphyletic with respect to other related genera in the subtribe Plectranthinae. The most recent taxonomic treatment of the genus resurrected Coleus, and 212 names were changed from combinations in Plectranthus, Pycnostachys and Anisochilus. Equilabium was segregated from Plectranthus, after phylogenetic studies supported its recognition as a phylogenetically distinct genus. Common names for Coleus include spurflower, flybush, hedgehog flower and hullwort. Coleus are cultivated as ornamental plants, particularly Coleus scutellarioides (syns. Coleus blumei, Plectranthus scutellarioides), which is popular as a garden plant for its brightly colored foliage. Other species that produce root tubers are cultivated for food, including Coleus esculentus, Coleus rotundifolius and Coleus maculosus subsp. edulis.The genus Coleus was first described by João de Loureiro in 1790.

It has a long flowering period, from spring to fall in subtropical areas, and throughout the year closer to the equator. It is often associated with disturbed soils. In both it native range and areas where it has been introduced it is usually considered a weed, sometimes a serious one. In the United States it has been placed on the Federal Noxious Weed List. It is considered a moderate weed of rice cultivation in Asia. In its native range of sub-Saharan Africa, India, Sri Lanka, and much of Southeast Asia, it is considered a serious weed of an enormous range of crops from tea and coffee to cassava and peanuts. Additional agricultural damage is caused by the fact that it can host the nematode Meloidogyne incognita and the Groundnut rosette virus. In China it is used as a medicinal herb that is said to have diuretic, febrifugal and anti-inflammatory effects, while in Pakistan it is used to cure swellings of the skin, leprosy and as a laxative.Commelina benghalensis is a wide-ranging plant, being native to tropical and subtropical Asia and Africa, an area otherwise known as the paleotropics.

The species is very similar to Commelina paludosa, and further study is needed to recognize the boundary between the two. The two are typically differentiated on the basis of C. paludosa having larger and more numerous spathes that occur in clusters of four to ten, forming a sort of head. C. paludosa is also reported to have larger leaves, a more erect habit, less branching, and thicker stems. On the other hand, C. maculata is supposed to have heads of only two to three spathes, low-growing stems, numerous branches, slender stems that root at the nodes, and leaves less than ten cm long by two and a half cm wide. == References =="

The plant is herbaceous, with no woody parts, and has a biennial lifecycle. Under the right conditions, the plant grows quite rapidly during the growing season and can reach heights of 2.4 metres (8 feet) with a long penetrating root. The plant has a distinctive odour that is usually considered unpleasant and carries with the wind. The hollow stems are usually spotted dark maroon and turn dry and brown after the plant completes its biennial lifecycle. Native to Europe and North Africa, hemlock is a hardy plant that can live in a variety of environments. It is widely naturalised outside its native range, including in Australia, West Asia, and North and South America, where it can become an invasive weed. All parts of the plant are toxic, particularly the seeds and roots, and especially when ingested. Hemlock is well-known as the poison that killed the philosopher Socrates after his trial in Ancient Greece.Conium maculatum is a herbaceous flowering plant that typically grows as a biennial, but can grow as a perennial on occasion. The second year stems topped with flowers grow to between 0.5 and 3 m (1.6 and 9.8 ft) in height; they are coarse and branch frequently.

It is usually found at ground level with small white and pink flowers. Other common names, mostly obsolete, include lesser bindweed, European bindweed, withy wind (in basket willow crops), perennial morning glory, small-flowered morning glory, creeping Jenny, and possession vine.Field bindweed was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the Species Plantarum. In the following centuries, many subspecies, varieties, and synonymous taxa were discovered and described as purportedly new species in places including China, Russia, Egypt, and Morocco. New species and forms were described as far as Chile, Mexico, and the state of California when botanists encountered the plant there, although it is not native to these areas. In the ninth volume of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle's Prodromus, published in 1845, Jacques Denys Choisy reduced a number of these synonyms to ten varieties of Convolvulus arvensis, although he also recognized a number of species now also reduced to synonyms of C. arvensis. Over time, most or all of these species and varieties were no longer recognized by the relevant authorities.

The leaves are alternate, simple, lanceolate, 5–15 cm long, with an acuminate tip and a finely serrated or lobed margin. The flowers are small (2–3 cm diameter) and yellow, with five petals; the fruit is a many-seeded capsule. The genus Corchorus is classified under the subfamily Grewioideae of the family Malvaceae. It contains around 40 to 100 species. The genus Oceanopapaver, previously of uncertain placement, has recently been synonymized under Corchorus. The name was established by André Guillaumin in 1932 for the single species Oceanopapaver neocaledonicum Guillaumin from New Caledonia.

Different common names are used in different contexts, with jute applying to the fiber produced from the plant, and jute mallow leaves for the leaves used as a vegetable.The plants are tall, usually annual herbs, reaching a height of 2–4 m, unbranched or with only a few side branches. The leaves are alternate, simple, lanceolate, 5–15 cm long, with an acuminate tip and a finely serrated or lobed margin. The flowers are small (2–3 cm diameter) and yellow, with five petals; the fruit is a many-seeded capsule. The genus Corchorus is classified under the subfamily Grewioideae of the family Malvaceae. It contains around 40 to 100 species. The genus Oceanopapaver, previously of uncertain placement, has recently been synonymized under Corchorus. The name was established by André Guillaumin in 1932 for the single species Oceanopapaver neocaledonicum Guillaumin from New Caledonia.

However, if grown for fibre production, it can reach heights up to 4 m (13 ft). The taproot leads to a sturdy and hairless stem, which is green with a faint red-brownish hue and sometimes turns a little woody on ground level. The serrate acute leaves alternate, are 6 to 10 centimetres (2+1⁄4 to 4 in) long and 2 to 4 cm wide. The plant carries the flowers solitary or in two-flowered cymes opposite of the leaf. The flowers sit on the end of a short stem, count 5 sepals, 5 petals and 10 free and yellow stamina. The fruit is spindle-shaped, dehiscent and divided into transversal sections through five valves. The fruit measures 2 to 8 cm in length and colors vary from greyish-blue to green or brownish-black. Every seed chamber contains 25 to 40 seeds, which sum up to 125 to 200 seeds per fruit.

It has been used in many ways, not only as fuel source, fodder (for livestock) and timber but the trees also yield edible nuts for human consumption or for folk medicine uses.Corylus jacquemontii is a medium-sized, upright growing, deciduous tree. It grows up to 15–25 m (49.2–82.0 ft) tall. It has pale grey, or dark grey bark, which has deep vertical cracks that can help it be separated into small cork-like plates. The young twigs of the Corylus are yellowish-grey, rather sparsely pubescent (covered with short, soft hairs) and with longer, glandular hairs later in life. It flowers in India, between March and April. Elsewhere, it flowers between April and May. They are very, small flowers, in male catkins which are 2–4 cm (0.8–1.6 in) long and also female spikes, and they appear before the leaves. It has 6–15 cm (2.4–5.9 in) long and 5–12 cm (2.0–4.7 in) wide leaves, which are broadly ovate, or obovate (teardrop-shaped), with the tip of the leaf acuminate (tapering to a long point).

Depending on the species definition used, between 70 and 300 different species of Cotoneaster are described, with many apomictic microspecies treated as species by some authors, but only as varieties by others. The majority of species are shrubs from 0.5–5 m (1.6–16.4 ft) tall, varying from ground-hugging prostrate plants to erect shrubs; a few, notably C. frigidus, are small trees up to 15 m (49 ft) tall and 75 cm (30 in) trunk diameter. The prostrate species are mostly alpine plants growing at high altitudes (e.g. C. integrifolius, which grows at 3,000–4,000 m (9,800–13,100 ft) in the Himalayas), while the larger species occur in scrub and woodland gaps at lower altitudes.The shoots are dimorphic, with long shoots (10–40 cm (3.9–15.7 in) long) producing structural branch growth, and short shoots (0.5–5 cm (0.20–1.97 in) long) bearing the flowers; this pattern often developing a 'herringbone' form of branching. The leaves are arranged alternately, 0.5–15 cm (0.20–5.91 in) long, ovate to lanceolate in shape, entire; both evergreen and deciduous species occur.

    "knowledge_text": "Crocus sativus, commonly known as saffron crocus or autumn crocus, is a species of flowering plant in the iris family Iridaceae. A cormous autumn-flowering cultivated perennial, unknown in the wild, it is best known for the culinary use of its floral stigmas as the spice saffron. Human cultivation of saffron crocus and the trade and use of saffron have endured for more than 3,500 years and span different cultures, continents, and civilizations.The plant is most commonly known as the saffron crocus. The alternative name autumn crocus is also used for species in the Colchicum genus, which are not closely related but strongly resemble the true crocuses; in particular, the superficially similar species Colchicum autumnale is sometimes even referred to as meadow saffron. However, the true crocuses have three stamens and one style supporting three long stigmas, while colchicums have six stamens and three styles; and belong to a different family, Colchicaceae. Colchicums are also toxic, making it particularly crucial to distinguish them from the saffron crocus. Crocus sativus is a perennial herb that grows about 10 to 30 cm high. It develops as an underground corm, which produces leaves, bracts, bracteole, and the flowering stalk. It generally blooms with purple flowers in the autumn. Flowers are sterile, have six petals and three red to orange colored stigmas. Leaves are simple, rosulate in arrangement with entire margins. Saffron crocus is a triploid with 24 chromosomes (2n = 3x ="

It has been introduced as a crop plant in many tropical areas and has escaped from cultivation to become a troublesome weed; it is listed as a noxious weed in several US states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and is listed as an invasive weed in India, Cuba, and Cocos Island. Unlike some other species of Crotalaria, it is an annual plant.It is an annual herb, about 60–150 centimetres (2–5 ft) high, with erect, angular, green branches. The soft leaves (dark green on the upper surface, lighter underneath) are alternate, and narrowly oblong or wedge-shaped. The yellow flowers grow widely spaced in racemes at the end of the stem. The pods are thin walled, and widely spaced along the stems, and when ripe are purple to black, containing about 18-20 small brown seeds. In Australia, where it is considered a native, it grows in the Kimberley on sand, clay, sandstone, and rocky basaltic soils, and is found along creeks and rivers, and on the floodplains.

The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. Silene species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals (gynodioecy), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility. Two independent groups of species in Silene have evolved separate male and female sexes (dioecy) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals. Silene flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as Rhingia campestris. Silene species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution.

    "knowledge_text": "Cucumis melo, also known as melon, is a species of Cucumis that has been developed into many cultivated varieties. The fruit is a pepo. The flesh is either sweet or bland, with or without an aroma, and the rind can be smooth (such as honeydew), ribbed (such as European cantaloupe), wrinkled (such as Casaba melon), or netted (such as American cantaloupe). The species is sometimes referred to as muskmelon. However, there is no consensus about the usage of this term, as it can also be used as a specific name for the musky netted-rind American cantaloupe, or as a generic name for any sweet-flesh variety such the inodorous smooth-rind honeydew melon. The origin of melons is not known. Research has revealed that seeds and rootstocks were among the goods traded along the caravan routes of the Ancient World. Some botanists consider melons native to the Levant and Egypt, while others place their origin in Iran, India or Central Asia. Still others support an African origin; in modern times, wild melons can still be found in some African countries.The melon is an annual, trailing herb.

The flesh is either sweet or bland, with or without an aroma, and the rind can be smooth (such as honeydew), ribbed (such as European cantaloupe), wrinkled (such as Casaba melon), or netted (such as American cantaloupe). The species is sometimes referred to as muskmelon. However, there is no consensus about the usage of this term, as it can also be used as a specific name for the musky netted-rind American cantaloupe, or as a generic name for any sweet-flesh variety such the inodorous smooth-rind honeydew melon. The origin of melons is not known. Research has revealed that seeds and rootstocks were among the goods traded along the caravan routes of the Ancient World. Some botanists consider melons native to the Levant and Egypt, while others place their origin in Iran, India or Central Asia. Still others support an African origin; in modern times, wild melons can still be found in some African countries.The melon is an annual, trailing herb.

Considered an annual plant, there are three main types of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and seedless—within which several cultivars have been created. The cucumber originates in Asia extending from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, China (Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi), and Northern Thailand, but now grows on most continents, and many different types of cucumber are grown commercially and traded on the global market. In North America, the term wild cucumber refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, though the two are not closely related.The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium, whereby it will sprawl along the ground in lieu of a supporting structure. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits. The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 62 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (4 in) in diameter. Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table). In botanical terms, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with seeds and an outer rind.

Cucurbita maxima, known for modern varieties as Hubbard, Delicious, Marblehead, Boston Marrow, and Turks Turban, originated in northern Argentina near the Andes or in certain Andean valleys. Secondary centers of diversity include India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and the southern Appalachians. Different squash types of this species were introduced into North America as early as the 16th century. By the American Revolution, the species was in cultivation by Native American tribes throughout the present-day United States. By the early 19th century, at least three varieties are known to have been commercially introduced in North America from seeds obtained from Native Americans. As of October 2024, Cucurbita andreana is accepted as a separate species by some sources, and a subspecies of C. maxima by others. It was first formally described by Charles Victor Naudin in 1896, in Revue Horticole. It is native to Argentina and Uruguay and is the ancestor of the domesticated forms. C. andreana fruits are smaller and not palatable. It hybridizes readily with individuals of other C. maxima subspecies.

Some authors maintain that C. pepo is derived from C. texana, while others suggest that C. texana is merely feral C. pepo. They have a wide variety of uses, especially as a food source. C. pepo seems more closely related to C. fraterna, though disagreements exist about the exact nature of that connection, too. It is a host species for the melonworm moth, the squash vine borer, and the pickleworm. They are also the preferred pollen source for squash bees, which are the primary pollinators in the Americas.Due to their varied genetic background, members of C. pepo vary widely in appearance, primarily in regards to their fruits. The plants are typically 30–76 centimetres (1–2+1⁄2 ft) high and 61–91 cm (2–3 ft) wide, with yellow flowers. Within C. pepo, the pumpkins, scallops, and possibly crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated separately. The domesticated species have larger fruits and larger yet fewer seeds.

Cupressus sempervirens is important in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern culture. In Iran it is both a sacred tree and a metaphor for \"the graceful figure of the beloved\".Cupressus sempervirens is a medium-sized coniferous evergreen tree growing up to 35 m (115 ft) tall, with a conic crown with level branches and variably loosely hanging branchlets. It is very long-lived, with some trees reported to be over 1,000 years old. Cupressis sempervirens produces lateral shoots, or branches, which often grow upwards towards a light source. The foliage grows in dense, dark green sprays. The leaves are scale-like, 2–5 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed cones are ovoid or oblong and 25–40 mm long. The cones have 10–14 scales, which are green at first and mature to brown about 20–24 months after pollination. The male cones are 3–5 mm long and release highly allergenic pollen in late winter.

It was first described in China in 1786.C. chinensis is a thin, yellow vine lacking leaves or roots. It produces glomerulate to dense paniculiform inflorescences composed of white-cream 5-merous flowers that are very small, have two styles with capitate stigmata, and produce 3–4 obovoid seeds per capsule. Its pollen grains are small, colporate, and covered by a finely reticulate ektexine. C. chinensis var. chinensis has been observed to flower from June–October, December–March, and February–May. It is found throughout western Asia, tropical Asia, eastern Asia, and Australasia at latitudes between 20° N and 50° N. Specimens of Cuscuta campestris are occasionally mislabeled as C. chinensis; the two species can be differed by C. chinensis's carinate calyx lobes, incurved but not inflexed corolla lobes, and dehiscent seed capsule. C. chinensis var. applanata flowers from June to October and is found in Mexico and the southwestern US. C. chinensis is used medicinally in many Asian countries, including China, Korea, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, Thailand, Nepal, and Inner Mongolia. Biochemical analysis has found at least 93 pharmacologically active phytochemicals present in C. chinensis correlated with its use as an anti-inflammatory agent, anti-aging agent, pain reliever, or aphrodisiac. In Traditional Chinese Medicine Cuscuta chinensis is used as a tonic medicine by traditional Chinese medicine practitio"

The plant is widely cultivated in Hawaii, both for its appearance in landscape and interiors, and for cut foliage. The seed is poisonous. The potent poison in the seeds is removed by soaking them in water. Water from the first seed-soaking will kill birds, goats, sheep and hogs. Water from the following soakings is said to be harmless. [Minimum of 5 Soakings needed to ensure the safety] After the final soaking, the seeds are dried and ground into flour. The flour is used to make tortillas, tamales, soup and porridge. The plant was thought to be linked with the degenerative disease lytico-bodig on the island of Guam; however, the cycad native to Guam has since been recognised as a separate species, Cycas micronesica, by K.D.

The ripe fruit is aromatic but remains hard; gritty stone cells are dispersed through the flesh. It is larger than many apples, weighing as much as 1 kilogram (2.2 lb), often pear-shaped but sometimes roughly spherical. The seeds contain nitriles, common in the seeds of the rose family.

Contrary to its common name, Cynodon dactylon is not native to Bermuda but is an abundant invasive species there. In Bermuda, it has been known as crabgrass (also a name for Digitaria sanguinalis). Other names include dhoob, dūrvā grass, ethana grass, dubo, dog grass, dog's tooth grass, Bahama grass, devil's grass, couch grass, Indian doab, arugampul, grama, wiregrass, and scutch grass. Hybrid species of the grass are taxonomically known as Cynodon dactylon × transvaalensis. These interspecific hybrids are the result of cross-pollination between different cultivars. Hybrid cultivars of the grass are commonly developed by selecting individual plants with desirable traits from seeded or vegetatively propagated stands. These cultivars are typically triploids, meaning they contain three sets of chromosomes.The blades are grey-green in color and short, usually 2–15 cm (0.79–5.91 in) long with rough edges. The erect stems can grow 1–30 cm (0.39–11.81 in) tall. The stems are slightly flattened, often white or green, and occasionally tinged purple in colour. The seed heads are produced in a cluster of two to six spikes together at the top of the stem, each spike 2–5 cm (0.79–1.97 in) long. Cynodon dactylon has a deep root system.

It has been introduced into North America, and it is considered to be a troublesome weed because its burs stick to the wool of sheep and to other animals. Houndstongue is also toxic to cattle and other grazing animals due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which when ingested can lead to liver damage and photosensitivity in livestock.As of July 2024, there are 81 accepted species in the genus: Oncaglossum pringlei (Greenm.)

It grows as a perennial herb. It grows in water or near it in rivers, streams, lakes, and swamps with a hyperhydrate (emergent aquatic) or possibly tenagophyte (submerged juvenile and terrestrial adult) growth pattern. It is widespread across tropical and subtropical regions in Africa, southern Asia, northern Australia, the southeastern United States, the West Indies, and Latin America. While it is closely related to highly invasive sedges such as purple nut sedge (Cyperus rotundus), priprioca is less prolific and competitive than its relative.It is similar in appearance to C. corymbosus but with terete culms with 5–20 mm long intersepta and is transversely septate. Its leaf blades are completely absent and it has scale-like involucral bracts measuring less than 15 mm long. The anthers are 1.0–1.5 mm long and the floral glumes are 2.25–3.5 mm in length. Priprioca is related to other nut sedges (such as tigernut), and its roots release a light, woody, and spicy fragrance with floral notes. It is one of the traditional spices of the Amazon region, used medicinally in local tradition, and its reddish essential oil is used commercially both by the cosmetic industry, and increasingly as a flavoring for food.

The word cyperus derives from the Greek κύπερος, kyperos, and rotundus is from Latin, meaning \"round\". The earliest attested form of the word cyperus is the Mycenaean Greek 𐀓𐀞𐀫, ku-pa-ro, written in Linear B syllabic script.Cyperus rotundus is a perennial plant, that may reach a height of up to 140 cm (55 in). The names \"nut grass\" and \"nut sedge\" – shared with the related species Cyperus esculentus – are derived from its tubers, that somewhat resemble nuts, although botanically they have nothing to do with nuts. As in other Cyperaceae, the leaves sprout in ranks of three from the base of the plant, around 5–20 cm (2–8 in) long. The flower stems have a triangular cross-section. The flower is bisexual and has three stamina and a three-stigma pistil, with the inflorescence having three to eight unequal spikes. The fruit is a three-angled achene. Young plants initially form white, fleshy rhizomes, up to 25 mm (1.0 in) in dimension, in chains. Some rhizomes grow upward in the soil, then form a bulb-like structure from which new shoots and roots grow, and from the new roots, new rhizomes grow. Other rhizomes grow horizontally or downward, and form dark reddish-brown tubers or chains of tubers. C. esculentus – is visually similar"

    "knowledge_text": "In biology, a stolon ( from Latin stolō, genitive stolōnis – \"branch\"), also known as a runner, is a horizontal connection between parts of an organism. It may be part of the organism, or of its skeleton. Typically, animal stolons are exoskeletons (external skeletons).In botany, stolons are plant stems which grow at the soil surface or just below ground that form adventitious roots at the nodes, and new plants from the buds. Stolons are often called runners. Rhizomes, in contrast, are root-like stems that may either grow horizontally at the soil surface or in other orientations underground. Thus, not all horizontal stems are called stolons. Plants with stolons are called stoloniferous. A stolon is a plant propagation strategy and the complex of individuals formed by a mother plant and all its clones produced from stolons form a single genetic individual, a genet. Stolons may have long or short internodes. The leaves along the stolon are usually very small, but in a few cases such as Stachys sylvatica are normal in size. Stolons arise from the base of the plant. In strawberries the base is above the soil surface; in many bulb-forming species and plants with rhizomes, the stolons remain underground and form shoots that rise to the surface at the ends or from the nodes. The nodes of the stolons produce roots, often all around the node and hormones produced by the roots cause the stolon to initiate shoots with normal leaves.

It grows as both an evergreen and a deciduous tree in the deciduous monsoon forests of India making the tree very drought hardy. Haematonectria haematococca is a fungal pest of the tree, causing damage to the leaves and the heartwood in Javanese plantations. In India, trees may be subject to serious damage from a species of Phytophthora, a water mold genus. Germplasm resources for D. latifolia are maintained by the Kerala Forest Research Institute in Thrissur, Kerala, India. The tree produces a hard, durable, heavy wood that, when properly cured, is durable and resistant to rot and insects. It is grown as a plantation wood in both India and Java, often in dense, single species groves, to produce its highly desirable long straight bole. Wood from the tree is used in premium furnitur"

It is more rarely called sacred datura, a common name which is applied more often to the closely related Datura wrightii. It is native to the Southwestern United States, Central and South America, and introduced in Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe. The scientific name is often cited as D. innoxia. When English botanist Philip Miller first described the species in 1768, he misspelled the Latin word innoxia (inoffensive) when naming it D. inoxia. The name Datura meteloides was for some time erroneously applied to some members of the species, but that name has now been abandoned.Datura innoxia is a tuberous-rooted subshrub that typically reaches a height of 0.6 to 1.5 metres. Its stems and leaves are covered with short and soft grayish hairs, giving the whole plant a grayish appearance. It has elliptic smooth-edged leaves with pinnate venation. All parts of the plant emit a foul odor similar to rancid peanut butter when crushed or bruised, although most people find the fragrance of the flowers to be quite pleasant when they bloom at night. The flowers are white, trumpet-shaped, 12–19 cm (4.5–7.5 in) long. They first grow upright, and later incline downward. It flowers from early summer until late fall. The fruit is an egg-shaped"

It is one of the important drugs used as indigenous medicine in India, especially in Unani medicine. Its vernacular name is Jadwar. The roots of the plant are reported to be useful in a variety of ailments such as aconite poisoning, brain diseases, fungal infection, piles and toothache as analgesic and astringent. A number of studies have been done on its phytochemical and pharmacological properties. Its use in opium addiction is mentioned in some classical literature, which has been verified and validated in morphine-induced physical dependent de-addiction studies. Some species are reported to have been poisonous. == References =="

It usually grows in exposed positions in lowland rainforest and coastal scrub.Dendrobium crumenatum produces upright, sympodial, pseudobulbs 300–700 mm (10–30 in) long and 8–12 mm (0.31–0.47 in) wide that are swollen at the first three or four lower nodes. The middle portion of the pseudobulb has two rows of leathery, oblong to egg-shaped leaves 50–80 mm (2–3 in) long and 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) wide. Top portion of the pseudobulb bears pure white flowers 30–40 mm (1–2 in) long and wide. The dorsal sepal and petals are 15–18 mm (0.6–0.7 in) long and 5–7 mm (0.2–0.3 in) wide, the lateral sepals slightly longer and wider. The labellum is 20–24 mm (0.8–0.9 in) long and 13–15 mm (0.5–0.6 in) wide with three lobes. The side lobes are erect and the middle lobe is rounded with five yellow ridges. Flowering is sporadic but is triggered nine days after a sudden drop in temperature of at least 5.5 °C, usually as a result of rain, although the same effect can be artificially created. The flowers are fragrant, but the scent lasts only for one day. Joseph Arditti describes the flowering as \"gregarious\".

It can grow up to 2–4 feet tall. The leaves are simple and alternate. They have an oblong shape and pinnate venation. They tend to grow up to 15 cm in length and 5 cm in width. The flowers have bilateral symmetry and are characterized for purple and white colors, and they have 3 petals. The inflorescence is indeterminate meaning that the growing flowers are on the top while the full flowers are on the lower part. The sexual reproductive system is hermaphroditic. Pleurolobus gangeticus is found in places with partial shade or in the open, and very rarely in deep shade. It is native to tropical Africa, Asia, and northern Australia. Its biome is typically anthropogenic habitats in the lowlands, under ever wet or seasonal conditions. This plant grows best in dry conditions with clayey loam soils that are alkaline and moderately calcareous. The plant also uses pollinator such as bees and is frequently grazed by cattle which aids with seed dispersal. The plant spreads its seed through the small hairs on the seedpods that readily cling to human skin and clothing as well as other animals’ fur and feathers. This ensures that the seed gets maximum dispersal. Due to this method the plant is considered an invasive weed in some habitats. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria fo"

While its exact natural range is uncertain due to extensive cultivation over the last 2,000 years, wild carnations are most common in the Mediterranean region. Carnations are prized for their wide variety of colors, delicate fringed petals, and fragrance, often described as spicy, clove-like, or reminiscent of a combination of cinnamon and nutmeg, hence the common name \"clove pink\". This aroma has made carnations a popular choice for use in perfumes, potpourri, and scented products. Culturally, carnations are associated with affection, distinction, and maternal love, with variations depending on color and area within its wide geographical range.Carnations were mentioned in Greek literature 2,000 years ago. The term dianthus was coined by Greek botanist Theophrastus, and is derived from the Ancient Greek words for divine (\"dios\") and flower (\"anthos\"). The name \"carnation\" is believed to come from the Latin corona, a \"wreath, garland, chaplet, crown\", as it was one of the flowers used in Greek and Roman ceremonial crowns, or possibly from the Latin caro (genitive carnis), \"flesh\", which refers to the natural colour of the flower, or in Christian iconography incarnatio, \"incarnation\", God made flesh in the form of Jesus.

This herbaceous perennial has several geographical variants. It is native to warm, open woodland habitats in southern Europe, north Africa and much of Asia.This plant grows about 40 cm (16 in) to 100 cm (39 in) high. Its flowers form a loose pyramidal spike and vary in colour from pale purple to white. The flowers are five-petalled with long projecting stamens. The leaves resemble those of an ash tree. Several varieties and cultivars have been selected for garden use. The variety D. albus var. purpureus in which the violet-purple is confined to veining of white petals with a slight blush, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Dictamnus is tap-rooted, making mature plants difficult to establish and resistant to division; young plants often need three years before they begin to flower, and since it is late to break into leaf in spring, even quite mature clumps may be harmed with vigorous soil-working in spring. For all these reasons, added to toxicity of the foliage, Dictamnus is rarely seen in American gardens. The leaves have a bitter and unpalatable taste. Despite the lemon-like smell, the plant is acrid when eaten. All parts of the plant may cause mild stomach upset if eaten, and contact with the foliage may cause phytophotodermatitis.

It is the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin). This biennial plant grows as a rosette of leaves in the first year after sowing, before flowering and then dying in the second year (i.e., it is monocarpic). It generally produces enough seeds so that new plants will continue to grow in a garden setting.Digitalis purpurea is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, 10–35 cm (3.9–13.8 in) long and 5–12 cm (2–5 in) broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year. The flowering stem develops in the second year, typically 1–2 m (3.3–6.6 ft) tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent.

The leaves are 15–36 cm long, occasionally to 75 cm (30 inches) with a conspicuously corrugated surface with impressed parallel veins. The flowers are large, 15–20 cm diameter with five white or creamy yellow petals. They have two sets of stamens: outer straight stamens 13–15 mm long and inner bent yellow stamens 20–22 mm long. Its fruits are large, round and greenish yellow consisting of 15 carpels together having a diameter of 5–12 cm. Each carpel has five seeds embedded in an edible but fibrous and glutinous pulp. The name elephant apple comes from the fact that it produces a large hard edible fruit which is accessible only to the megaherbivores in the wild like elephants. A study in the Buxa Tiger Reserve by ecologists Sekar & Sukumar has shown that Asian elephants appear to have a particular fondness for the fruits of D. indica, and are hence an important seed disperser for this tree.

It is native to Africa, Asia and northern Australia. It is widely cultivated and has become naturalized in many regions.Dioscorea bulbifera is a perennial vine with broad, alternate leaves, and two types of storage organs. The plant forms bulbils in the leaf axils of the twining stems, and tubers beneath the ground. These tubers are like small, oblong potatoes. Air potato can grow extremely quickly, roughly 20 centimetres (8 in) per day, and eventually reach over 18 metres (60 ft) long. It typically climbs to the tops of trees and has a tendency to take over native plants. New plants develop from bulbils that form on the plant, and these bulbils serve as a means of dispersal. The aerial stems of air potato die back in winter, but resprouting occurs from bulbils and underground tubers. The primary means of spread and reproduction are by the bulbils. The smallest bulbils make control of air potato difficult due to their ability to sprout at a very small stage. The vine produces small white flowers; however, these are rarely seen when it grows in places such as Florida. The fruits are capsules. It is native to Africa, Asia and northern Australia.

    "knowledge_text": "Diospyros kaki, the Oriental persimmon, Chinese persimmon, Japanese persimmon, kaki persimmon, or Fuyu persimmon, is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Diospyros. Although its first botanical description was not published until 1780, D. kaki cultivation in China dates back more than 2000 years.Whether the species was first described by Carl Peter Thunberg or Carl Linnaeus the Younger is disputed. The scientific name Diospyros kaki L. f. may be used erroneously for this plant. However, Diospyros kaki L. f., published in 1781, is a later homonym of Diospyros kaki Thunb., published in 1780. So the name Diospyros kaki L. f. is taxonomically illegitimate and not accepted. It is called shi (柿) in Chinese, kaki (柿) in Japanese, gam (감) in Korean, kesemek in Indonesia and haluwabed (हलुवाबेद) in Nepali. Similar in shape to an apple tree, the Diospyros kaki tree reaches a size of up to 10 metres (33 ft). Its deciduous leaves are medium to dark green, broadly lanceolate, stiff and equally wide as long. Blooming from May to June, the trees are typically either male or female, but some produce both types of flowers. Furthermore, the sexual expression of a tree may vary from year to year. Unusually, the fruits ripen when the leaves have mostly fallen off the tree, typically in October and November. (Northern Hemisphere) Pestalotiopsis fungal spp. causes leaf spot on Diospyros kaki. Diospyros kaki trees typically do not bear until they are three to six years old. The flowers a"

In Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana it is known as tuniki. The leaves can be wrapped around tobacco to create the Indian beedi, which has outsold conventional cigarettes in India.D. melanoxylon is a shrub to medium-sized tree, growing up to 25 meters tall. It has alternate or opposite leaves, which grow up to 35 cm long. It has mauve-colored flowers at least 1-1.5 cm in size. It is dioecious. The fruit of the tree is olive-green outside and yellow inside, and about 3–4 cm in diameter. They are edible, by both humans and wildlife, particularly fruit bats and hornbills. The tree may be dry-season deciduous in a dry location, or evergreen in a moister habitat. Younger trees are shade-tolerant, but mature trees require full sun. D. melanoxylon prefers slightly acidic soils in the 5.5 - 7 pH range. The leaf of the tree contains valuable flavones. The pentacyclic triterpenes found in the leaves possess antimicrobial properties, while the bark shows antihyperglycemic activity.

Its natural geographical range includes the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia (India, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and China's Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Fujian provinces) and Australia. It is one of the fastest trapping sundews as well, and its leaves can curl around an insect in only a few seconds, compared to the minutes or hours it takes other sundews to surround their prey. In nature, D. burmanni is an annual, but in cultivation, when grown indoors during the cold months, it can live for many years. Since D. burmanni is an annual, it produces large amounts of seed. Drosera burmanni has been considered a powerful rubefacient in Ayurveda.Drosera burmanni is an herb that produces very short stems and red or green leaves in a rosette. It normally spans only 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter. Each leaf is wedge-shaped or orbicular that grows close to the soil level, it is typically 6–10 mm long and 4–6 mm wide. White flowers are produced in groups of 3 to 10 on 6–15 cm (2–6 in) tall racemose inflorescences, of which there can be one to three per plant. The first brief description of the species was written by Paul Hermann and published after Hermann's death by William Sherard in Musaeum Zeylanicum. It was described in more detail by Johannes Burman in his 1737 publication on the flora of Ceylon. Burman used the polynomial Ros solis foliis circa radicem in orbem dispositis"

In Australia at least four forms have had or still have specific taxonomic recognition: Drosera peltata subsp. peltata (an autonym), D. peltata subsp. auriculata, D. foliosa (also as D. peltata var. foliosa) and D. gracilis (also as D. peltata var. gracilis). Tuberous sundews are species of the genus Drosera that have evolved to live in summer drought conditions and aestivate as a dormant underground tuber. While many tuberous sundews are ground-hugging rosettes, D. peltata is an upright species with a simple or branching inflorescence.Drosera peltata is a perennial tuberous herb. Its underground tuber is generally found 4 – 6 cm under the soil surface, and its aerial parts range from 5 – 50 cm in height, with wide differentiation into several forms.

This was due to the abundance of these fern plants in the trunks and branches of the large trees, as well as the lowlands surrounding the area of the town.

Near the northern limit of its distribution it prefers sunny, well-drained sites. It is much less abundant in North America than in Europe.The semi-evergreen leaves have an upright habit and reach a maximum length of 150 cm (59 in), with a single crown on each rootstock. The bipinnate leaves consist of 20–35 pinnae on each side of the rachis. The leaves taper at both ends, with the basal pinnae about half the length of the middle pinnae. The pinules are rather blunt and equally lobed all around. The stalks are covered with orange-brown scales. On the abaxial surface of the mature blade five or six sori develop in two rows. When the spores ripen in August to November, the indusium starts to shrivel, leading to the release of the spores. This species hybridises easily with Dryopteris affinis (scaly male fern) and Dryopteris oreades (mountain male fern). The plant is sometimes referred to in ancient literature as worm fern, reflecting its former use against tapeworm.

Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance; others find the aroma overpowering and revolting. The persistence of its odour has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia. There are 30 recognised Durio species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit. D. zibethinus is the only species available in the international market: other species are sold in their local regions. There are hundreds of cultivars of D. zibethinus; many consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.The wood of D. zibethinus is reddish brown. D. zibethinus flowers are visited by bats which eat the pollen and pollinate the flowers. The flowers open in the afternoon and shed pollen in the evening. By the following morning, the calyx, petals, and stamens have fallen off to leave only the gynoecium of the flower.

It was once one of the major grasses cultivated in the Inner Niger Delta of the Niger River. It was cultivated by the Fulani people, who used the seeds as food, and to make both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. It tolerates floods well, and has been replanted in Africa, where it has helped to control erosion and provides hay for animals. A traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known grain has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.Fula: burgu Laotian: ປ້ອງ [pɔ̂ːŋ].

It is widely established in North America as an introduced species.Elaeagnus angustifolia is a thorny tree growing to 11 metres (35 feet) in height. Its stems, buds, and leaves have a dense covering of silvery to rusty scales. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, 4–9 centimetres (1+1⁄2–3+1⁄2 inches) long and 1–2.5 cm (3⁄8–1 in) broad, with a smooth margin. The plants begin to flower and fruit from 3 years old. The highly aromatic flowers, produced in clusters of one to three, are 1 cm long with a four-lobed creamy yellow calyx; they appear in early summer and are followed by clusters of fruit, a small cherry-like drupe 1–1.7 cm (3⁄8–5⁄8 in) long, orange-red covered in silvery scales. The fruits are about 1 cm wide and sweet, though with a dryish, mealy texture. The species is established and reproduced primarily by seed, with some vegetative propagation also occurring. The branches have thorns that can be 2–7 cm (3⁄4–2+3⁄4 in) long. The first scientific description of Elaeagnus angustifolia was by Carl Linnaeus under its present name in 1753. Its common name comes from its similarity in appearance to the olive (Olea europaea), in a different botanical family, the Oleaceae. According to Sudnik et al.

It has alternate pinnately compound leaves. The plant gives off a dark pink or bright red and speckled berry, oblong in shape and around the size of a grape or 75 cm (29.5 in) in diameter. The ripe fruit is pulpy with a sweet and slightly sour taste. The fruit stays on the tree for only for a short time of 4–5 weeks between September and October (Basumatary et al. 2020). The fruit of the plant species is used for making chutney, jam, jelly and refreshing drinks. E. latifolia is widely distributed from south-eastern Asia to the slopes of the Himalayas. It is also found in northeast India, Thailand, and Vietnam. They inhabit dense swamps at about 1,500 feet above sea level in the Himalayas as well as dwelling in vast forest openings in Nepal. It is suitable for growing in moist soil with any pH value and can also adapt to growing in regions where the soil is dry. Since E. latifolia can thrive in both moist and dry conditions, it can tolerate the most intense droughts. E. latifolia shares a symbiotic relationship with soil-dwelling bacteria that perform nitrogen fixation. The fruit is considered \"unusual\" because the fruit contains several \"good\" fatty acids, and was investigated for possible use against cancer.

The species is also now naturalised in Madagascar, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Central America, Cambodia, the West Indies, and several islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The closely related American oil palm E. oleifera and a more distantly related palm, Attalea maripa, are also used to produce palm oil. E. guineensis was domesticated in West Africa along the south-facing Atlantic coast. There is insufficient documentation and as of 2019 insufficient research to make any guesses as to when this occurred. Human use of oil palms may date as far back as 5,000 years in Egypt; in the late 1800s, archaeologists discovered palm oil in a tomb at Abydos, Egypt, dating back to 3000 BCE (but this information needs further investigation, due to recent reviews. The oil found in Abydos may be just date oil or even animal fats). It is the principal source of palm oil.

Different parts of the plant are used in traditional medicine of India as an astringent agent, cardiac tonic, and diuretic, and is used for eczema, rheumatism, fever, and bladder stones. E. scaber modulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the production of TNFα and IL-1β. The genus name Elephantopus comes from the Greek words \"elephantos\" (elephant) and \"pous\" (foot). The term likely refers to the large basal leaves of some members of the genus. Elephantopus scaber contains elephantopin which is a germacranolide sesquiterpene lactone containing two lactone rings and an epoxide functional group. 17,19-Dihydrodeoxyelephantopin, iso-17,19- dihydro-deoxy elephantopin and 8-hydroxyl naringenin are the most important bioactive compounds responsible for anti-bacterial activity.

It was claimed to have been found in an Indian archaeological site dated to 1800 BCE (Late Bronze Age); however, this was subsequently demonstrated to be incorrectly identified cleaned grains of hulled millets. The earliest record of finger millet comes from an archaeological site in Africa which is thought to date to the 3rd millennium BCE, although it has not been precisely dated. By 1996, cultivation of finger millet in Africa was declining rapidly because of the large amount of labor it required, with farmers preferring to grow nutritionally inferior but less labor-intensive crops such as maize, sorghum, and cassava.

    "knowledge_text": "Eleusine indica, the Indian goosegrass, yard-grass, goosegrass, wiregrass, or crowfootgrass, is a species of grass in the family Poaceae. It is a small annual grass distributed throughout the warmer areas of the world to about 50 degrees latitude. It is an invasive species in some areas. Eleusine indica is closely related to Eleusine coracana (finger millet or African finger millet), and the diploid E. indica is likely an ancestor of the allotetraploid E. coracana. Seeds of E. indica are edible and are sometimes used as a famine food, but yields are low. It is an important weed of cultivated crops, lawns, and golf courses. It thrives in disturbed areas with compacted soils in full sun. Both tillage and herbicides are used in its control. This low-growing grass is capable of setting seed even when closely mown. Some populations have evolved resistance to certain herbicides, including glyphosate. Eleusine indica performs C4 photosynthesis and therefore can grow in hot climates and in the hotter months of the temperate zone. Its seeds germinate later in spring than most other temperate zone weeds, such as crabgrasses. Though usually considered an annual, it may survive for more than a year in climates not subject to frost.

However, the exact extent of its original range is unclear. It is introduced in India and parts of North American and Europe. Some of its habitats include riverbanks, forests, and hills. Elsholtzia ciliata is an erect herb that grows to about 30–50 cm (12–20 in) in height. The leaves are simple and opposite with serrated margins.  Elsholtzia ciliata has many cultural uses. It is used in Vietnamese cuisine, where it is called rau kinh giới or lá kinh giới. The leaves are used to flavor meat dishes, soups, and salads with a lemony flavor. It is commonly used in herbal medicine, as it is considered to be carminative and astringent. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It prefers moist soil, and grows mostly on exposed rocky slopes and other open, gravelly areas. It is banned in the state of Connecticut and is classified as a noxious weed.

They probably arose from the closely related Enhydritherium, a bunodont otter endemic to North America during the late Miocene and early Pliocene epochs. Enhydra reevei, the oldest known species, has its origins in the Atlantic, suggesting this may have been where sea otters originated.

Like all horsetails, it is a type of fern. It is native throughout the arctic and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has two distinct growth forms, a fertile spore-bearing stem and a sterile green stem. It is sometimes confused with mare's tail, Hippuris vulgaris.Equisetum arvense is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by means of an underground rhizome. The slender, felted rhizome freely forks and bears stem tubers. The species is dimorphic, that is, it exhibits two distinct growth forms, both arising from the same rhizome. Fertile spore-bearing stems begin to appear in April. After shedding its spores, a fertile stem promptly whithers and dies. Sterile green stems appear around the same time but last throughout the summer until the first frosts of autumn. The erect or prostrate sterile stems are 10–90 cm (3.9–35.4 in) tall and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) diameter, with jointed segments around 2–5 cm (0.79–1.97 in) long with whorls of side shoots at the segment joints; the side shoots have a diameter of about 1 mm (0.039 in). Some stems can have as many as 20 segments. The solid and simple branches are ascending or spreading, with sheaths that bear attenuate teeth. The off-white fertile stems are of a succulent texture, 10–25 cm (3.9–9.8 in) tall and 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) diameter, with 4–8 whorls of brown scale leaves a"

It was the first weed to have developed glyphosate resistance, reported in 2001 from Delaware.Erigeron canadensis is an annual, herbaceous plant growing to 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall, with sparsely hairy stems. The leaves are unstalked, slender, 2–10 centimetres (0.8–3.9 inches) long, and up to 1 cm (0.4 in) wide, with a coarsely toothed margin. They grow in an alternate spiral up the stem, and the lower ones wither early. The flower heads are produced in dense inflorescences and are 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter. Each individual flower has a ring of white or pale purple ray florets and a centre of yellow disc florets. The fruit is a cypsela tipped with dirty white down. Erigeron canadensis can easily be confused with Erigeron sumatrensis, which may grow to a height of 2 m (6.6 ft), and the more hairy Erigeron bonariensis, which does not exceed 1 m (3.3 ft).

It is native to the cooler hill regions of south-central China. In Japan, the loquat has been grown for over 1,000 years. It has been introduced to regions with subtropical to mild temperate climates throughout the world. Eriobotrya japonica formerly was thought to be closely related to the genus Mespilus and is still sometimes mistakenly known as the Japanese medlar, which is the name it takes in other European languages, such as níspero japonés in Spanish or nespolo giapponese in Italian. It is also known as Japanese plum and Chinese plum.The name loquat derives from Cantonese lou4 gwat1 (Chinese: 盧橘; pinyin: lújú; lit. 'black orange'). The phrase 'black orange' originally referred to unripened kumquats, which are dark green in color, but the name was mistakenly applied to the loquat by the ancient Chinese poet Su Shi when he was residing in southern China, and the mistake was widely taken up by the Cantonese region thereafter. Its original name, lou-qwat, is no longer used in most Chinese dialects and has been replaced by pipa (枇杷), which is a reference to the fruit's visual resemblance to a miniature pipa lute.

It is native to Macaronesia, temperate Eurasia and north and northeast Africa, and was introduced to North America in the eighteenth century, where it has since become naturalized, particularly in the deserts and arid grasslands of the southwestern United States.Common stork's-bill is a perennial monoecious herb that typically grows in rosettes pressed flat to the ground, with a deep tap root that allows it to survive through the summer on dry soils. It can develop stems up to 60 cm long that are sometimes red and sometimes green, and may be erect or prostrate, and have simple or glandular hairs which become more abundant towards the top. Plants with glandular hairs are sticky, but those with simple hairs are much less so. It has no scent. The leaves are arranged in a basal rosette at the beginning of the year, later occurring in opposite pairs along the stem. They are pinnate, almost twice-pinnate as each leaflet is deeply toothed or divided more than halfway to the midrib, and the whole leaf can vary in size from 2–20 cm long, either with a petiole or not. Like the stems, the leaves can be covered with glandular or simple hairs. The stems bear bright pink flowers which often have dark spots on the bases.

The petals are creamy white with purple veins, and the stamens are yellow. The fruit is a siliqua (pod) 12 to 25 mm (1⁄2 to 1 in) long with an apical beak, containing several seeds. The species has a chromosome number of 2n = 22. Some botanists consider E. sativa a subspecies of Eruca vesicaria. However, they are different in many morphological aspects, such as sepal persistence, silique shape, and habit. Most importantly, they do not hybridise freely with each other as there is partial reproductive isolation between them.

The leaves are pinnate with a 20 cm (7.9 in) petiole and three leaflets, each leaflet up to 20 cm (7.9 in) long and broad. It has dense clusters of scarlet or crimson flowers and black seeds. Notably, crows have been observed contributing to the pollination of the Indian coral tree by feeding on its nectar-rich flowers. Erythrina variegata is valued as an ornamental tree. Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Alba' with white flowers. In Vietnam, the leaves are used to wrap fermented meat (Vietnamese: nem). E. variegata is known as dapdap in many languages of the Philippines where its bark and leaves are used in alternative medicine. E. variegata is often used in agroforestry systems. It can be used for fodder as its foliage has a good nutritive value for most livestock. The seeds are poisonous in their raw state but can be cooked and eaten. Along with the bark, the seeds were used to stupefy fish, making them easier to catch. The Formosan aboriginal Puyuma tribe carve a mortar called a taur from the trunk of the tree.

The leaves contain cocaine, which acts as a mild stimulant when chewed or consumed as tea; this traditional use involves slower absorption than purified cocaine, and there is no evidence of addiction or withdrawal symptoms from such natural consumption. The coca plant is a shrub-like bush with curved branches, oval leaves marked by distinct curved lines, and small yellowish-white flowers that develop into red berries. Genomic analysis indicates coca was domesticated two or three separate times from the wild species Erythroxylum gracilipes by different South American groups during the Holocene. Chewing coca leaves dates back at least 8,000 years in South America, as evidenced by coca leaves and calcite found in house floors in Peru's Nanchoc Valley, suggesting early communal use alongside the rise of farming. Coca use was widespread under Inca rule. The Incas deeply integrated it into their society for labor, religion, and trade, valuing it so highly that they colonized new lands for its cultivation. Although Spanish colonizers later attempted to suppress its use, they ultimately relied on it to sustain enslaved laborers. Traditionally, across Andean cultures, coca leaves have been used for medicinal, nutritional, religious, and social purposes—serving as a stimulant, remedy for ailments, spiritual tool, "

Species of Eucalyptus have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard, or stringy and leaves that have oil glands. The sepals and petals are fused to form a \"cap\" or operculum over the stamens, hence the name from Greek eû 'well' and kaluptós 'covered'. Most species of Eucalyptus are native to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. A few species are native to islands north of Australia, and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast-growing, have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, honey production, or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because of the danger of forest fires due to their high flammability. Eucalypts vary in size and habit from shrubs to tall trees. Trees usually have a single main stem or trunk but many eucalypts are mallees that are multistemmed from ground level and rarely taller than 10 metres (33 feet). There is no clear distinction between a mallee and a shrub but in eucalypts, a shrub is a mature plant less than 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall and growing in an extreme environment. Eucalyp"

There are four subspecies, each with a different distribution across Australia, occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. The subspecies are the Victorian blue gum, Tasmanian blue gum, Maiden's gum, and Victorian eurabbie.Eucalyptus globulus is a tree that typically grows to a height of 45 m (148 ft) but may sometimes only be a stunted shrub, or alternatively under ideal conditions can grow as tall as 90 m (300 ft), and forms a lignotuber. The bark is usually smooth, white to cream-coloured but there are sometimes slabs of persistent, unshed bark at the base. Young plants, often several metres tall, and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section with a prominent wing on each corner. Juvenile leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs, sessile, glaucous elliptic to egg-shaped, up to 150 mm (5.9 in) long and 105 mm (4.1 in) wide.

The genus has roughly 2,000 members, making it one of the largest genera of flowering plants. It also has one of the largest ranges of chromosome counts, along with Rumex and Senecio. Euphorbia antiquorum is the type species for the genus Euphorbia. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. Some euphorbias are widely available commercially, such as poinsettias at Christmas. Some are commonly cultivated as ornamentals, or collected and highly valued for the aesthetic appearance of their unique floral structures, such as the crown of thorns plant (Euphorbia milii). Succulent euphorbias from the deserts of Southern Africa and Madagascar have evolved physical characteristics and forms similar to cacti of North and South America, so they are often incorrectly referred to as cacti. Some are used as ornamentals in landscaping, because of beautiful or striking overall forms, and drought and heat tolerance. Euphorbia all share the feature of having a poisonous, latex-like sap and unique floral structures. When viewed as a whole, the head of flowers looks like a single flower (a pseudanthium).

It is a succulent and almost cactus-like in appearance, although unrelated. It grows right across the Himalaya mountains from Pakistan, India, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal to western China. It prefers dry and rocky slopes between 1000–1500 m altitude, but has been found up to 2000 m. Flowering and fruiting is in spring to early summer (March to July) and seeding is in June to October. It is used as a hedging plant in northern India and has medicinal uses. It is an outlier of an assembly of succulent tree spurges which are otherwise confined to South Africa, East Africa and Madagascar with another outlier in the caatinga of Brazil.Euphorbia royleana is a deciduous, cactus-like, shrub or small upright tree up to 2-7(-8) m high, which is armed with short prickles along its stems. It has a stout trunk and is glabrous except for the flowers (cyathia). The cyathia are small greenish-yellow, 3-4 appear in almost stalkless clusters in leaf axils. It has succulent segmented branches in whorls, which are green to greyish green, 4-7(-8) cm thick, with branching from the upper parts. The stems have ribs 5(-7), angles more or less undulately winged with rounded teeth/tubercles. It has stout tap roots. The stems become leafless during hot and cold seasons and the leaves are alternate, apically clustered. They are produced in the moist season and soon fall. They ar"

It has a cylindrical and fleshy stem with fragile succulent twigs that are 7 millimetres (0.28 in) thick, often produced in whorls, finely striated longitudinally. The oval leaves are 1 to 2.5 centimetres (0.39 to 0.98 in) long and about 3 to 4 millimetres (0.12 to 0.16 in) wide; they usually fall off early. It contains a milky, toxic and corrosive sap. The yellow flowers are at the ends of the branches. It has a wide distribution in Africa in black clay soils, being prominently present in northeastern, central and southern Africa. It may also be native in other parts of the continent as well as some surrounding islands and the Arabian Peninsula and has been introduced to many other tropical regions, such as Brazil, India, Vietnam, the Philippines and Ghana. It grows in dry areas, especially the savanna, and is often used to feed cattle or as hedging.

The leaves have an oblique base and are simple, elliptical to slightly rhombic, hairy (on both upper and lower surfaces but particularly on the veins on the lower leaf surface), with a finely dentate margin, the veins upperside being deep-set and conspicuous on the underside, and the leaf surface somewhat leathery. Leaves occur in opposite pairs on the stem. The flowers are unisexual and found in axillary cymes at each leaf node, held as dense balls of flowers and fruit capsules usually close to the stem, the flower glands with tiny white/pinkish petal-like appendages. The fruit is a capsule with three valves (creating 3 sides), uniformly appressed hairy, containing tiny (0.7–0.9 mm), oblong, four-sided orange to pink or red seeds. It has a white or brown taproot.

The genus has roughly 2,000 members, making it one of the largest genera of flowering plants. It also has one of the largest ranges of chromosome counts, along with Rumex and Senecio. Euphorbia antiquorum is the type species for the genus Euphorbia. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in Species Plantarum. Some euphorbias are widely available commercially, such as poinsettias at Christmas. Some are commonly cultivated as ornamentals, or collected and highly valued for the aesthetic appearance of their unique floral structures, such as the crown of thorns plant (Euphorbia milii). Succulent euphorbias from the deserts of Southern Africa and Madagascar have evolved physical characteristics and forms similar to cacti of North and South America, so they are often incorrectly referred to as cacti. Some are used as ornamentals in landscaping, because of beautiful or striking overall forms, and drought and heat tolerance. Euphorbia all share the feature of having a poisonous, latex-like sap and unique floral structures. When viewed as a whole, the head of flowers looks like a single flower (a pseudanthium). It has a unique kind of pseudanthium, called a cyathium, where each flower in the head is reduced to its bar"

The plant is a medium-sized slender shrub that can reach 10 m (33 ft) in height, and is often unbranched. The root has been used in traditional medicine in Southeast Asia over centuries. It is also a widely used dietary supplement by bodybuilders, who believe that it increases testosterone levels and athletic performance, although there is no clinical evidence for its effectiveness on health or any disease. Rare cases of liver injury have occurred from its use, mostly in bodybuilders.Eurycoma longifolia is also known by the common names penawar pahit, penawar bias, bedara merah, bedara putih, lempedu pahit, payong ali, tongkat baginda, muntah bumi, petala bumi, bidara laut (all Malay-Indonesian); babi kurus (Javanese); cây bá bệnh (Vietnamese); tho nan (Laotian); lan-don, hae phan chan, phiak, plaa lai phuenk, tung saw (all Thai); \"long jack\" (US); langir siam (Bahrain).

Most of the names refer to its toxic properties or its propensity to cause blindness when its latex comes into contact with the eyes. This plant grows in saline or brackish water in tropical mangrove forests, in a distribution bounded to the west by India, to the north by Bangladesh, to the south by Australia. Within Australia, it thrives from northern New South Wales along the northern coastline around to Western Australia.Mangrove swamps form a type of coastal wetland found in the tropics and subtropics. Within a mangrove forest, the most salt-tolerant species occur near the ocean. Excoecaria agallocha, known as a back mangrove, is found at higher elevations back away from the ocean where salinity is lower. Mangroves of this plant surround the ancient Thillai Chidambaram Temple in Tamil Nadu. This small tree species may grow up to 15 m high. Trees are either male or female (dioecious). Male flowers form drooping tassels, while female flowers appear as shorter spikes. Pollinators such as bees commonly visit the flowers. The fruit is a small dark capsule.

The genus is native to the Indian subcontinent, much of Indochina, central and southeastern China, and central and eastern tropical Africa. Species have been widely introduced elsewhere, throughout the Holarctic and parts of Africa and South America.Fagopyrum contains 30 species of plants, including two important crop plants, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), and Fagopyrum tataricum (Tartary buckwheat). The two have similar uses, and are classed as pseudocereals, because they are used in the same way as cereals but do not belong to the grass family Poaceae. Within Fagopyrum, the cultivated species are in the Cymosum group, including Fagopyrum cymosum or perennial buckwheat, the artificial hybrid Fagopyrum × giganteum, and Fagopyrum homotropicum. This genus has five-petaled flowers arranged in a compound raceme that produces laterally flowered cymose clusters. The genus Fagopyrum was first published by Philip Miller in 1754.

Buckwheat cultivation originated around the 6th millennium BC in the region of what is now Yunnan Province in southwestern China. The name \"buckwheat\" is used for several other species, such as Fagopyrum tataricum, a domesticated food plant raised in Asia. Despite its name, buckwheat is not closely related to wheat, nor is it a cereal or a member of the grass family. It is related to sorrel, knotweed, and rhubarb. Buckwheat is considered a pseudocereal because the high starch content of the seeds enables buckwheat to be cooked and consumed like a cereal. In the U.S., local varieties of buckwheat, tame buckwheat, is considered an economic threat, since many people in the Asian markets are highly allergic. Grain elevators use a zero tolerance policy where the occurrence of buckwheat in a load of grain means the entire load is rejected. Buckwheat allergy is especially common in Japan, with potential reactions almost as severe as peanut allergy.The name \"buckwheat\" or \"beech wheat\" comes from its tetrahedral seeds, which resemble the much larger seeds of the beech nut from the beech tree, and the fact that it is used like wheat. The word may be a translation of Middle Dutch boecweite: boec \"beech\" (Modern Dutch beuk; see PIE *bhago-) and weite \"wheat\" (Mod. Dut. tarwe, antiquated weit), or may be a native formation "

Tartary buckwheat is more bitter and contains more rutin than common buckwheat. It also contains other bioactive components such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, 2-hydroxybenzylamine and quercitrin.Known in Chinese as \"bitter buckwheat\" (Chinese: 苦荞麦; pinyin: kǔqiáomài) and in Japan as dattan-soba (韃靼蕎麦/ダッタンソバ; 'Tartary buckwheat'), the plant was domesticated as a crop in East Asia and is also being cultivated in Europe and North America. While it is an unfamiliar food in the West, it is common in the Himalayan region today, as well as other regions in Southwest China such as Sichuan province. Tartary buckwheat is commonly roasted to make buckwheat tea, and it can also be distilled to make alcohol. While not traditionally eaten in Japan, due to its high rutin content it was briefly popular as a health fad in Japan in the late 1990s. The plant has been cultivated in many parts of the world; however, when found among other crops it is considered a weed. Less bitter varieties are now commercially available.

It is obtained from the taproot of several plant species in the genus Ferula (family Apiaceae), which are native to Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia. The substance is solid, with colors ranging from pale pink to dark reddish brown, and is characterized by a strong, pungent odor often compared to that of garlic, onion, rotten eggs, or coal gas. This odor is the basis of the term \"fetid\" in its name. Like other related resins, including galbanum and sagapenum, asafoetida was known in Greco-Roman antiquity. Its historical use partly overlaps with that of the now-extinct silphium, a plant highly valued in the ancient Mediterranean world for its reputed medicinal and culinary properties. Asafoetida is frequently mentioned in Ayurvedic texts, later in Arabo-Persian medical treatises, in medieval herbals, in the literature of traditional Chinese medicine, and in the pharmacopoeias of the early modern period. The taxonomy of plants producing asafoetida is complex and has been subject to differing interpretations. The resin is most commonly associated with Ferula assa-foetida and Ferula foetida, which were long treated as synonyms. Ferula narthex is also frequently cited as a source. Additional Ferula species are mentioned in the specialized literature, although they appear to be of lesser economic importance and may differ substantially in their phytochemical composition.

The species was named in honor of the Scottish botanist George Arnott Walker-Arnott.Ficus arnottiana is a medium to large deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters (66 feet) in height. The tree has a spreading canopy, and its bark is smooth and grayish-white. The leaves are large, ovate to heart-shaped, and have a distinctive glossy green surface with prominent veins. Unlike Ficus religiosa (a species that it is commonly mistaken for), its leaves have a more pointed and acuminate rather than a long tapering one. The tree produces small, round figs that are initially green and turn reddish when ripe. These figs grow in pairs along the branches and serve as a crucial food source for birds, bats, and other wildlife. Like other Ficus species, F. arnottiana has a mutualistic relationship with fig wasps, which pollinate its flowers. This species is native to the Indian subcontinent and predominantly found in India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It grows in dry deciduous forests, on rocky slopes, and near riverbanks observed mostly in clay to a well drained soil with quite some water and lots of sun. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can often be seen growing on cliffs and large boulders.   Data related to Ficus arnottiana at Wikispecies Media related to Ficus arnottiana at "

It is resistant to drought and mild frost. It produces propagating aerial roots that grow downward. Once these roots reach the ground, they take root and become supportive woody trunks. The figs produced by the tree are eaten by birds such as the Indian myna. Fig seeds that have passed through the digestive system of birds are more likely to germinate than those that have not. Banyan trees reproduce easily by seed or by stake, and they often spread from the original place by means of aerial roots that anchor in the ground and begin to grow and thicken to the point that they \"become independent\" from the original trunk, thus managing to \"emigrate\" sometimes at great distances. The figs are eaten by all kinds of frugivorous birds such as the coppersmith barbet and the common myna.

It inhabits a variety of forests, along with forest edge, rubber plantations and Falcataria falcata groves, mainly in lowland areas. A striking, large-bodied bird with a length of 21.5–23.0 cm (8.5–9.1 in), it is unlikely to be mistaken for another species. The broadbill is mostly purplish-red, with yellow-streaked black wings, a bright blue beak, a blackish face and greyish chin and upper breast. Females can be told apart from males by their lack of a black neckband, although these are indistinct in Bornean and Javan males. Despite its conspicuous appearance, the bird is usually hard to see due to its sluggishness and is usually only noticed when it vocalises. The species mainly eats arthropods such as orthopterans (grasshoppers, katydids and crickets), true bugs and beetles, but has also been recorded feeding on snails, lizards, frogs and figs. On the mainland, breeding generally occurs during the dry season; populations in the Greater Sundas have a longer breeding season lasting from March to November.

Male trees are hermaphrodites with both staminate flowers that produce pollen and pistillate flowers that produce almost no seeds but can form galls containing pollinator wasp larvae. Female trees have pistillate flowers that do produce seeds but are inhospitable to pollinator wasp larvae. It occurs in many parts of Asia and as far south east as Australia. There is a large variety of local common names. Like a number of ficus, the leaves are sandpapery to touch. An unusual feature is the figs which hang on long stems.In Australia the fruit are eaten by cassowaries and double-eyed fig parrots. Phayre's leaf monkey feeds on the leaves as do the larvae of the moth Melanocercops ficuvorella. The fig wasp Apocrypta bakeri has F. hispida as its host, where it parasitizes the pollinator fig wasp Ceratosolen solmsi. The yet unnamed nematode species Caenorhabditis sp. 35 has been found in Aceh, Indonesia, associated with the tree. == References =="

It was first described in 1782, and is a culturally significant plant in a number of Asian countries.Ficus microcarpa is a large tropical tree that grows to 25 m (82 ft) tall, occasionally to 35 m (115 ft), with innumerable aerial roots descending from the branches that have the capacity to develop into accessory trunks or \"prop roots\". It may initially be epiphytic, lithophytic or terrestrial. The leaves are narrowly to broadly elliptic, measuring up to 12 cm (4.7 in) long by 9 cm (3.5 in) wide. They are glabrous (without hairs) and have 5–9 pairs of main lateral veins either side of the midrib, which form distinct loops within the leaf margin. Ficus microcarpa was described in 1782 by Carl Linnaeus the Younger. The species has a considerable number of synonyms. In 1965, E. J. H. Corner described seven varieties (and two forms of Ficus microcarpa var. microcarpa) which were regarded as synonyms under the name of Ficus microcarpa in the latest Flora Malesiana volume.

It is a fast-growing plant with large, very coarse leaves, attaining the size of a large shrub or even larger in old specimens. A distinctive feature of its growth habit is the cauliflorous nature of its fruiting, where the syconia (figs) grow in dense clusters directly from the trunk and larger branches. The ripe figs are a favourite food of the rhesus macaque, and the plant also serves as a host for the caterpillars of the two-brand crow butterfly (Euploea sylvester) of northern Australia. The species is of cultural importance in Hinduism and Buddhism. The tree is also important to native people of Borneo such as in Sabah, Malaysia, where it is called Nunuk Ragang.The cluster fig is deciduous or semi-deciduous, reaching 15–20 metres (49–66 ft) in height. Older specimens can grow quite large and gnarled, up to 30 metres (98 ft) high. It has a wide-spreading crown with irregular branches and a thick, often buttressed trunk covered in smooth greyish bark that may flake with age. Like other species in the genus Ficus, the tree produces milky latex which can irritate the skin. The tree has a shallow and extensive root system, often developing aerial roots in humid environments.

The sacred fig is considered to have a religious significance in four major religions that originated on the Indian subcontinent: Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. Hindu and Jain ascetics consider the species to be sacred and often meditate under it. Gautama Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment under a tree of this species. The sacred fig is the state tree of the Indian states of Odisha, Bihar and Haryana.Ficus religiosa is a large dry season-deciduous or semi-evergreen tree up to 30 metres (98 ft) tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 3 metres (9.8 ft). The leaves are cordate in shape with a distinctive extended drip tip; they are 10–17 centimetres (3.9–6.7 in) long and 8–12 centimetres (3.1–4.7 in) broad, with a 6–10 centimetres (2.4–3.9 in) petiole. The fruits are small figs 1–1.5 centimetres (0.39–0.59 in) in diameter, green ripening to purple.

The erect, perennial shrub grows 1.5 m to 2 m tall. The leaves are ovate to oblong with pinnate venation and wavy margins. It flowers from October to December. Each small, white pea-shaped flower is enclosed by a pair of reniform flower bracts. The alternating bracts are arranged in 2 files along the raceme, and eventually turn papery as they dry out. The small, cylindrical pods release their tiny black and red seeds by explosive dehiscence. In many parts of the Indian subcontinent it is used as a traditional medicine to treat epilepsy, hysteria and fever. It is an essential part of the Bihu (গৰু বিহু) festival, during which the cattle are washed and gently beaten with twigs of this plant.

The stem is hollow, erect, and glaucous green, and it can grow up to 2.1 meters (7 feet) tall. The leaves grow up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) long; they are finely dissected, with the ultimate segments filiform (threadlike), about 0.5 millimeters (1⁄64 in) wide. Its leaves are similar to those of dill, but thinner. The flowers are produced in terminal compound umbels 5–17.5 cm (2–7 in) wide, each umbel section having 20–50 tiny yellow flowers on short pedicels. The fruit is a dry schizocarp from 4–10 mm (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, half as wide or less, and grooved.

It is also widely cultivated as an ornamental and reportedly naturalized in Austria, Sicily, and Washington State, USA. The common names and the epithet \"imperialis\", literally \"of the emperor\", refer to the large circle of golden flowers, reminiscent of an emperor's crown.Fritillaria imperialis grows to about 1 m (3 ft) in height, and bears lance-shaped, glossy leaves at intervals along the stem. It bears a prominent whorl of downward facing flowers at the top of the stem, topped by a 'crown' of small leaves, hence the name. While the wild form is usually orange-red, various colours are found in cultivation, ranging from nearly a true scarlet through oranges to yellow. The pendulous flowers make a bold statement in the late spring garden; in the northern hemisphere, flowering takes place in late spring, accompanied by a distinctly foxy odour that repels mice, moles and other small animals.

It was the original source of iodine, discovered in 1811, and was used extensively to treat goitre.The fronds of F. vesiculosus grow to 150 cm (59 in) long and 2.5 cm (1 in) wide and have a prominent midrib throughout. It is typically attached by a basal disc-shaped holdfast but can also be unattached. It has almost spherical air bladders, which are usually paired one on either side of the mid-rib but may be absent in young plants. The margin is smooth and the frond is dichotomously branched. It is sometimes confused with Fucus spiralis with which it hybridises and is similar to Fucus serratus. Plants of F. vesiculosus are dioecious. Gametes are generally released into the seawater under calm conditions, and the eggs are fertilized externally to produce a zygote. Eggs are fertilized shortly after being released from the receptacle. A study on the coast of Maine showed that there was 100% fertilization at both exposed and sheltered sites. Continuously submerged populations in the Baltic Sea are very responsive to turbulent conditions. High fertilization success is achieved because the gametes are released only when water velocities are low. Individuals of F. vesiculosus from the North Sea col"

It is a herbaceous annual plant growing to 1 m tall; it is a pioneer species and thrives on disturbed sites or roadsides. The plant looks like mint but is taller. The stems have reflexed hairs and swollen nodes. In cross section, the stem is square. The leaves are rhombic to elliptic, with coarsely to bluntly serrate edges. The flowers are multicoloured, with purple, pink, or white areas; diminutive, bilateral and snapdragon-like, and are mostly visited by bumblebees. The species is considered by some authorities to have arisen as a natural hybrid between Galeopsis pubescens and Galeopsis speciosa.Common hemp-nettle is an erect annual plant and grows to a height of about 20 to 70 cm (8 to 28 in). The stem branches occasionally and is squarish and hairy, with glandular hairs on the upper part of the plant. The nodes are swollen and widely spaced and the pale green, stalked leaves are in opposite pairs. The leaf blades are hairy and are ovate with a long tapered tip and with regular large teeth on the margin. The inflorescence forms a terminal spike and is composed of whorls of pinkish flowers with dark markings on the lower lip. The calyx has five sharp-pointed lobes and the corolla forms a two-lipped flower about 15 to 20 mm (0.6 to 0.8 in) long with a fused tube. The upper lip of each flower is convex with dense, glandula"

It is naturalized in Tasmania, New Zealand, Canada, and the northern half of the United States. Galium verum is an upright plant, with stiff stems growing to 15–120 centimetres (5.9–47.2 in) tall. The leaves are 1–3 cm (0.39–1.18 in) long and 2 millimetres (0.079 in) broad, shiny dark green, hairy underneath, borne in whorls of 8–12. The flowers are 2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) in diameter, yellow, and produced in dense clusters. This species is sometimes confused with Galium odoratum, a species with traditional culinary uses.In medieval Europe, the dried plants were used to stuff mattresses, as the coumarin scent of the plants acts as a flea repellant. The flowers were also used to coagulate milk in cheese manufacture (which gives the plant its name, from the Greek word γάλα, gala 'milk') and, in Gloucestershire, to colour the cheese double Gloucester. The plant is also used to make red madder-like and yellow dyes. In Denmark, the plant (known locally as gul snerre) is traditionally used to infuse spirits, making the uniquely Danish drink bjæsk.

It is grown mainly in Southeast Asia, southwest India and other tropical areas such as Colombia, Puerto Rico and Florida, where the tree has been introduced. The tree grows from 6 to 25 m (19.7 to 82.0 ft) tall. The fruit of the mangosteen is sweet and tangy, juicy, somewhat fibrous, with fluid-filled vesicles and an inedible, deep reddish-purple colored rind (exocarp) when ripe. The fragrant edible flesh that surrounds each seed is the endocarp, i.e., the inner layer of the ovary. The seeds are of similar size and shape to almonds. The genus Garcinia also contains several less-known fruit-bearing species, such as the button mangosteen (G. prainiana) and the charichuelo (G. madruno). A tropical tree, the mangosteen must be grown in consistently warm conditions, as exposure to temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) for prolonged periods will usually kill a mature plant. They are known to recover from brief cold spells rather well, often with damage only to young growth. Experienced horticulturists have grown this species outdoors, and brought them to fruit in extreme south Florida. The tree grows from 6 to 25 metres (20 to 82 feet) tall.

The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus and John Ellis after Alexander Garden (1730–1791), a Scottish naturalist. The type species is Gardenia jasminoides, as first published by Ellis in 1761.Gardenia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, however some species, such as those native to New Guinea, may grow to 20-30m tall. A small number of species found in tropical East Africa and southern Africa grow as small pyrophytic subshrubs. At least one species, Gardenia epiphytica, native to Gabon and Cameroon, grows as an epiphyte. Most species are unarmed and spineless, but some species such as some of those found in Africa are spinescent. The leaf arrangement is typically opposite or verticillate may (arranged in whorls). Leaves vary by species; many species are glossy with a distinctly coriaceous (or leathery) texture such as that seen in Gardenia jasminoides, whilst in others, leaves may be thin and chartaceous (or paper-like). The flowers, particularly in the species most commonly grown in gardens, may be large and showy and white, cream or pale yellow in color, with a pleasant and strong, sometimes overpowering scent that may be more noticeable at night, something quite typical of moth-pollinated plants. Gardenia flowers are hermaphrodite (or bisexual) with each individual flower having both m"

In drier and sunnier conditions, like exposed slopes and thickets, it is a small narrow-leaved shrub. Gaultheria fragrantissima ranges from India and Sri Lanka through Nepal, Tibet, and the Himlalayas to south-central China, and to Vietnam, Myanmar, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, and Bali. Gaultheria fragrantissima is native to montane tropical and subtropical forests from 1,375 to 2,650 metres elevation. It can be found in a variety of conditions, including in the understorey of mature forests and at forest margins on humus-rich moist soils, as well as on drier and exposed slopes among other shrubs.

In cell-free systems gelonin exerts powerful N-glycosidase activity on the 28S rRNA unit of eukaryotic ribosomes by cleaving out adenine at the 4324 site. Gelonin lacks carbohydrate-binding domains so it is unable to cross the plasma membrane, making it highly effective only in cell free systems.Gelonin is a 30 kDa protein. Gelonin is a dimer, consisting of two identical monomers. Each monomer is composed of 251 amino acids, for a total of 502 residues. Gelonin is classified as an (α + β) protein, as its secondary structure consists of both beta sheets and alpha helices. Each monomer’s first 100 amino acids form 10 beta sheets, while their last 151 amino acids form 10 alpha helices. Gelonin’s two dimers are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Specifically, the Asn22, Arg178, Asn180, and Lys237 residues of each monomer hydrogen bond with each other to stabilize the molecules. Likewise, the hydrophobic residues Tyr14, Ile15, Val16 and Pro38 from one monomer form hydrophobic interactions with the same residues in the adjacent monomer to further stabilize the dimer. Gelonin’s active site is a cleft formed by six key residues: Tyr74, Gly111, Tyr113, Glu166, Arg169, and Trp198.

The flowers are pinkish-purple, 8–12 mm in diameter, with very jagged petals. It blooms from April to September. The flowers are hermaphrodite and mainly pollinated by Hymenoptera. Fruits are glabrous, usually with 6-9 transverse ridges.  It is native to the Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean areas, but has naturalized in other parts of Europe, in southwestern and central Asia and in North Africa, though it may have already been in those parts and areas, just not properly identified.

Gerbera is also commonly known as the African daisy. There are also different colors of gerberas.The genus was named in honour of German botanist and medical doctor Traugott Gerber (1710–1743), who travelled extensively in Russia and was a friend of Carl Linnaeus. Gerbera species are tufted, caulescent, perennial herbs, often with woolly crown, up to 80 cm high. Leaves are all in rosette, elliptical with entire or toothed margin or lobed, petiolate or with a petaloid base, pinnately veined, often leathery and felted beneath. Single to several flowering stems from each rosette bear bracteate or ebracteate, simple, one-headed inflorescence-capitulum. Capitula are radiate, with several rows of bracts. Ray florets are female, 2-lipped, the outer lip is large and strap-shaped, inner lip consists of two small, thread-like lobes of white, pink or red, rarely yellow colour. Disc florets are fertile, five-lobed and irregularly 2-lipped with curled petals.

Outside its natural range it can be an aggressive, damaging invasive species.The honey locust, Gleditsia triacanthos, can reach a height of 20–30 m (65–100 ft). They exhibit fast growth, but live a medium life span, as long as 125 years. The leaves are pinnately compound on older trees but bipinnately compound on vigorous young trees. The leaflets are 1.4–3.6 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) long when compound and very slightly smaller when bipinnate. The leaves are green in summer and turn yellow in autumn in shades ranging from cream and tan to golden yellow. Honey locusts leaf out relatively late in spring, but generally slightly earlier than the black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). The strongly scented flowers appear in late spring. Each cluster is a raceme 3–7 centimeters long with many tiny greenish-yellow to greenish-white flowers. The trees are polygamous-dioecious: many trees have only pollen producing flowers or seed producing flowers (strictly dioecious), but some will have both types of flowers in separate clusters, though usually one type will predominate.

Soybean oil is widely used in cooking, as well as in industry. Traditional unfermented food uses of soybeans include edamame, as well as soy milk, from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, nattō, and tempeh. Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes. Soy-based foods are traditionally associated with East Asian cuisines, and still constitute a major part of East Asian diets, but processed soy products are increasingly used in Western cuisines. Soy was domesticated from the wild soybean (Glycine soja) in north-central China between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago. Brazil and the United States lead the world in modern soy production. The majority of soybeans are genetically modified, usually for either insect, herbicide, or drought resistance. Three-quarters of soy is used to feed livestock, which in turn go to feed humans.

The liquorice plant is an herbaceous perennial legume native to West Asia, Tropical Asia, North Africa, and Southern Europe. Liquorice is used as a flavouring in confectionery, tobacco, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, and is marketed as a dietary supplement. Liquorice extracts have been used in herbalism and traditional medicine. Excessive consumption of liquorice (more than 2 mg/kg [0.91 mg/lb] per day of pure glycyrrhizinic acid, a key component of liquorice) can lead to undesirable consequences. Clinically, it is suspected that overindulgence in liquorice may manifest as unexplained hypertension, low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia), and muscle weakness in individuals. Consuming liquorice root extract should be avoided during pregnancy.The word liquorice (UK, CAN), or licorice (US), is derived via the Anglo-French lycorys, from Late Latin liquiritia, itself ultimately derived from Greek γλυκύρριζα, glykyrrhiza (the Modern Greek spelling of the genus is γλυκόριζα, glykoriza) literally meaning 'sweet root' and referring to Glycyrrhiza glabra.

Since the 1960s, it has been introduced extensively as fast-growing timber trees in Brazil, Gambia, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Malawi, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Sierra Leone. It is also planted in gardens and avenues. The species is fast-growing and thus raised in large-scale plantations to produce wood for construction, crafts, paper pulp, fuel, and charcoal. It produces high-quality wood used in the manufacture of furniture and to make plywood, matches and agricultural implements. The nectar of the flowers yields high-quality honey.

    "knowledge_text": "Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum, synonyms including Helichrysum luteoalbum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. In the United Kingdom, it is known as the Jersey cudweed.It is an erect herbaceous biennial up to 70 cm (28 in) tall, branching from the base. Leaves are oblanceolate to lanceolate and covered in hairs like that of the edelweiss. The leaves can survive freezing in winter. Flowers are cream, yellow, white, or pink. Seeds have a pappus which lets them float over long distances. This species was first published by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species plantarum, under the name Gnaphalium luteo-album (the orthography was later changed to omit the hyphen). In 1829, Ludwig Reichenbach transferred it to Helichrysum, but this name was not taken up, and the species was retained in Gnaphalium until 1981, when Olive Mary Hilliard and Brian Laurence Burtt transferred it into Pseudognaphalium. In 2004, an investigation into the phylogenetic relationships of Helichrysum and related genera found this species to have arisen within Helichrysum. As a result of this, Reichenbach's long-forgotten name for this species was resurrected. A later study suggested that all the sampled Pseudognaphalium species arose within Helichrysum as did Anaphalis, Achyrocline and Humeocline. Subsequent phylogenetic studies showed that Helichrysum, Anaphalis and Pseudognaphalium formed a clade, but retained these genera. The botanical Latin specific epithet luteoalbum translates as 'pale yel"

It is distributed in tropical and southern Africa and Madagascar; more than half of all the species are endemic to South Africa. Gnidia was named for Knidos, an Ancient Greek city located in modern-day Turkey. These are perennial herbs and shrubs, sometimes with rhizomes. Most species have alternately arranged leaves, and a few have opposite leaves. The leaves are undivided and unlobed. The inflorescence is a head of a few to many flowers. The calyx is cylindrical and the colored lobes may alternate with the petals; some species lack petals. Many species are similar in appearance and difficult to tell apart. Molecular analyses have provided evidence that the genus is polyphyletic, made up of four different lineages. They are related to the four genera Struthiola, Drapetes, Lasiosiphon, and Pimelea. Formerly 140 to 160 species were classified in the genus. Many have been reassigned to other genera and Plants of the World Online currently accepts 104 species.104 species are accepted.

Its branches, which are purple in color, are covered with fine hairs. Stipules are present at the leaf base and they are linear to lanceolate in shape and sometimes falcate (i.e. sickle-shaped). The leaves are attached to the stem by a 1.5 to 10 cm petiole. The blades are ovate to orbicular in shape and have five to seven lobes, making them superficially resemble a maple leaf. The lobes are linear to lanceolate, and often a tooth is present in the sinus. Glands are present along the midrib or occasionally on the adjacent nerves. The leaves are glabrescent, meaning the pubescence is lost with age, but when it is present on young leaves, it is both stellate (i.e. star-shaped) and simple.

Their flowers are small and yellow with a purple center. The plant exhibits extrafloral nectaries (calyculal nectaria, found on the receptacle, near the base of the calyculus). When ripe and in warm weather, the flower capsule will burst and expose the cotton surrounding the seeds firmly. The cotton produced by this plant is short, about 25 millimetres (1 in) long and is firmly attached to the seed, which is covered in hairy down. Cotton fibres grow from the surface of the seeds and can be separated from these by hand or mechanically; the long fibres are called lint. The cotton fibres consist of nearly pure cellulose. The expected yield is 340 kilograms per hectare (300 pounds per acre). The main use of cotton lint is to produce textiles for clothing. The fibres are spun into yarns and these are woven into fabrics, in the farm or house or in factories. Cotton as a fabric is much appreciated because of its comfortable, breathable properties, its resistance and also because it is easily stained.

Formerly, Grewia was placed in either the family Tiliaceae or the Sparrmanniaceae. However, these were both not monophyletic with respect to other Malvales - as already indicated by the uncertainties surrounding placement of Grewia and similar genera - and have thus been merged into the Malvaceae. Together with the bulk of the former Sparrmanniaceae, Grewia is in the subfamily Grewioideae and therein the tribe Grewieae, of which it is the type genus. The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus, in honor of the botanist Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712) from England. Grew was one of the leading plant anatomists and microscope researchers of his time, and his study of pollen laid the groundwork for modern-day palynology.Several Lepidoptera caterpillars are found to feed on Grewia species. These include the common nawab (Polyura athamas) and the swift moth Endoclita malabaricus. The Bucculatricidae leaf miner Bucculatrix epibathra is apparently only found on G. tiliaefolia. The parasitic wasp Aprostocetus psyllidis of the Eulophidae occurs on and around phalsa (G. asiatica). Its larvae are parasitoids of other insects - possibly pests of the plant, but this is not known for sure. Several species, namely phalsa, are known for their edible fruit, which are of local commercial importance. The astringent and refreshing Grewia drupes are particularly popular i"

The leaves are broadly rounded, 5–18 cm long and broad, with a petiole 1–1.5 cm long. The flowers are produced in cymes of several together, the individual flowers about 2 cm diameter, yellow, with five large (12 mm) sepals and five smaller (4–5 mm) petals. The fruit is an edible drupe 5–12 mm diameter, purple to black when ripe.It is extensively cultivated for its sweet and sour acidic fruit, which is sold in the market during the summer months under the name falsa. The flower blooms in April and the fruit is ripe by the end of May. It is available for a very short period in the market, and is at its maximum by the middle of June. A Sharbat or squash is prepared from the fruit pulp by mixing it with sugar and used as an astringent, stomachic and cooling agent. The root is used by Santhal tribals for rheumatisms. The stem bark is said to be used in refining sugar, for making ropes and its infusion is used as a demulcent. The leaves are used as an application to pustular eruptions.

The leaves are elongated-oval in shape. It has a small, yellow, umbelliferous inflorescence that is produced throughout the year. Gymnema sylvestre has a long history of use in herbal medicine and a broad range of therapeutic properties. Its leaves contain triterpenoid saponins, flavonols, and gurmarin. The major biologically active plant molecules are gymnemic acids, a class of triterpenoid saponins, which have the effect of suppressing the taste of sweetness on the tongue from sucrose (sugar), stevia, xylitol, and artificial sweeteners such as aspartame. The sweet-blocking effect of G. sylvestre lasts from 15 to 50 minutes and may even persist for several hours. Gymnemic acids apparently have no long-term effects on taste and they do not influence bitter, salty, or sour taste perception. Gymnemic acid compounds in Gymnema sylvestre can also attach to receptors on the intestinal walls, helping to reduce absorption of sugar molecules in the "

The seeds of this plant have been confused with Hydnocarpus wightianus as the chaulmoogra oil, which is used in Indian medicine to treat several skin conditions and diseases. During British rule, several British doctors studied the use of this oil in the treatment of leprosy, lupus, scrofula, and many skin diseases. The oil was prescribed for leprosy as a mixture suspended in gum or as an emulsion. However, it has later been clarified that the actual chaulmoogra referred to in Sanskrit texts for the treatment of leprosy, as Tuvaraka is actually Hydnocarpus wightianus. Gynocardin is a chemical compound, classified as a cyanogenic glycoside, that was first isolated from Gynocardia odorata and characterized in 1905. == References =="

The tree was of great economic importance from the 17th century to the 19th century, when it was commonly logged and exported to Europe for use in dyeing fabrics. The modern nation of Belize developed from 17th- and 18th-century logging camps established by the English. The tree's scientific name means \"bloodwood\" (haima being Greek for blood and xylon for wood).Haematoxylum campechianum was used for a long time as a natural source of dye. The woodchips are still used as an important source of haematoxylin, which is used in histology for staining. The bark and leaves are also used in various medical applications. In its time, it was considered a versatile dye, and was widely used on textiles and also for paper. The extract was once used as a pH indicator. Brownish when neutral, it becomes yellow reddish under acidic conditions and purple when alkaline. In a small demonstrative experiment, if two drops, one of concentrated ammonia and one of logwood extract, are placed close enough, the NH3 vapours will change the color of the extract to a purple shade.

The leaves have a rough, hairy texture. Larger leaves on the lower stem are broad ovoid-acute and can be up to 30 cm (12 in) long. Leaves higher on the stem are smaller and narrower. The flowers are yellow and produced in capitate flowerheads, which are 5–10 cm (2–4 in) in diameter, with 10–20 ray florets and 60 or more small disc florets. The flowers are briefly fragrant, giving off a light, vanilla-chocolate perfume. The tubers are often elongated and uneven, typically 7.5–10 cm (3–3+7⁄8 in) long and 3–5 cm (1–2 in) thick, and vaguely resembling a ginger root in appearance, with a crisp and crunchy texture when raw. They vary in color from pale brown to white, red, or purple. The tubers can be eaten raw, cooked, or pickled. Before the arrival of Europeans, indigenous peoples cultivated H. tuberosus as a food source. The tubers persist for years after being planted, so the species expanded its range from central North America to the eastern and western regions. Early European colonists learned of this and sent tubers "

The species has also become a naturalised weed in tropical and subtropical regions in the Americas and East Asia. The plant grows to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) in height and is favoured in most environments by frequent burning. The plants develop characteristic dark seeds with a single long awn at one end and a sharp spike at the other. The awn becomes twisted when dry and straightens when moistened, and in combination with the spike is capable of drilling the seed into the soil. The species is known by many common names, including black speargrass, tanglehead, steekgras (in Afrikaans) and pili (in Hawaiian, ultimately from Proto-Austronesian *pilit₁ \"to adhere/stick\"). H. contortus is a valuable pasture species across much of its range. However, it has also been responsible for the elimination of the wool industry over much of Australia due to the seeds becoming embedded in the wool and skin of sheep and devaluing the wool and killing the animals. H. contortus seeds are also responsible for similar injuries in dogs with thick undercoats, or becoming embedded in the socks and skin of hikers.Native Hawaiians used pili to thatch hale (houses).

They tend to be large shrubs or treelike in zones 9 and 10, though they have a more modest shrub-like appearance more north. Stems and petioles feature dense stellate and glandular hairs. Flowers can be double or single and are 4–6 in (10–15 cm) in diameter; they open white or pink, and change to deep red by evening. The 'Rubra' variety has red flowers. Single blooming flowers are generally cup-shaped. Bloom season usually lasts from summer through fall. When it does not freeze, the Confederate rose can reach heights of 12–15 ft (3.7–4.6 m) with a woody trunk. However, a much bushier plant 5–6 ft (1.5–1.8 m) high is more typical and provides more flowering. The flowers are attractive to pollinators, including the specialized bee Ptilothrix bombiformis. Propagation by root cuttings is the easiest and is done in early spring, but cuttings can be taken at almost any time. These plants have a very fast growth rate. The Confederate rose was at one time very prevalent in the area of the Confederate States of America, which is how its common name was derived. It grows nicely in full sun or partial shade, and prefers rich, well-drained soil. In cultivation in the UK, Hibiscus "

It is the national flower of South Korea and is mentioned in the South Korean national anthem.Hibiscus syriacus is a hardy deciduous shrub. It is upright and vase-shaped, reaching 2–4 m (7–13 feet) in height, bearing large trumpet-shaped flowers with prominent yellow-tipped white stamens. The flowers are often pink in color, but can also be dark pink (almost purple), light pink or white. Individual flowers are short-lived, lasting only a day. However, numerous buds produced on the shrub's new growth provide prolific flowering over a long summer blooming period. The soil in which the Hibiscus thrives is moist but well-drained, and organically rich. Hibiscus syriacus is highly tolerant of air pollution, heat, humidity, poor soil and drought. The species has naturalized very well in many suburban areas and might even be termed slightly invasive, so frequently does it seed.

It has been introduced to the United States as an ornamental where it has become naturalized as a weed of cropland and vacant land, particularly on disturbed ground.The plant grows to a height of 20–50 centimetres (8–20 in), sometimes exceeding 80 cm (30 in), and has white or yellow flowers with a purple centre. In the deeply pigmented centre of the flower, the surface features striations, which have been the subject of controversy about whether they act as a diffraction grating, creating iridescence. The pollinated but unripe seedpods look like oriental paper lanterns, less than 25 mm (1 in) across, pale green with purple highlights. The flowers of Hibiscus trionum can set seed via both outcrossing and self-pollination. During the first few hours after anthesis, the style and stigma are erect and receptive to receive pollen from other plants. In the absence of pollen donation, the style bends and makes contact with the anthers of the same flower, inducing self-pollination.

The broadly elliptic leaves can be up to 5 inches (13 centimeters) long and taper with teeth towards the base. Each flower head has 40-80 ray florets but no disc florets. Bracts surround the flower head; the receptacle (basal part of the flower on which the florets are attached) is flat and naked; heads tend to start together then become somewhat solitary on long leafless stems.

The concept of Homonoia was an ancient Greek concept which traditionally was not applied beyond their own culture. The Greeks viewed Homonoia as an absence of factional fighting in their city states. The Greeks viewed outside cultures as \"barbarians\". The famed scholar Aristotle once told his student, a young Alexander the Great, \"treat Greeks as friends, but [non-Greeks] as animals.\" It was the scholar Isocrates who first looked beyond the Greek people. While he didn't preach that the savages of the non-Greek world could be on par with the superior Greek people, he did believe they could be made Greek and thus be of one mind together. He claimed that Greekness could become a matter of nurture rather than nature. It was during his time spent in the court of Philip II of Macedon that Isocrates was able to teach the concept to an influential audience. Philip II took much of the concept to heart, but he too viewed it as a method reserved for the Greeks. He used the concept as his driving force behind creating the Corinthian League, an alliance to unite the Greek States for a war against the Persian Empire.

Its use then spread throughout Eurasia by 2000 BC. Barley prefers relatively low temperatures and well-drained soil to grow. It is relatively tolerant of drought and soil salinity, but is less winter-hardy than wheat or rye. In 2023, barley was fourth among grains in quantity produced, 146 million tonnes, behind maize, rice, and wheat. Globally, 70% of barley production is used as animal feed, while 30% is used as a source of fermentable material for beer, or further distilled into whisky, and as a component of various foods. It is used in soups and stews and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt using a traditional and ancient method of preparation. In English folklore, John Barleycorn personifies the grain and the alcoholic beverages made from it. English pub names such as The Barley Mow allude to its role in the production of beer.The Old English word for barley was bere.

The proximal part of the stem is trailing and produces adventitious roots, while the distal part of the stem grows vertically. The leaves are alternate, broadly heart-shaped, 4–9 cm (1+1⁄2–3+1⁄2 in) long and 3–8 cm (1–3 in) broad. Its flowers are greenish-yellow and borne on a terminal spike 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄4 in) long with four to six large white basal bracts. It normally blooms in the summer. It is considered an invasive plant because of its ability to regrow rhizomes from any segment of its foliage. It is native to Nepal, Taiwan, Myanmar, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Japan, China, Thailand, Vietnam and Korea. In South Korea, it is found in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Ulleungdo, and the Southern region. Houttuynia cordata grows in moist to wet soil or slightly submerged in water, as long as it is exposed partially or fully to the sun.

The branchlets are leafless at the base and instead have a pair of recurved spines which bear a resemblance to a moustache, giving rise to the epithet mystax, Latin for moustache. The Tamil name, mothira-kanni, refers to the resemblance to a ring. The roots of the plant are astringent and bittersweet, and are used to treat fevers, verminosis, and inflammations. The species is common in the dry scrub and tropical dry evergreen forests of peninsular India south from Maharashtra to Orissa. It flowers according to the rains, twice a year in some parts of the peninsula. The flowers are pollinated by Apis bees. The fruits are eaten by birds and seeds may be dispersed by them. The leaves are used in traditional medicine and used as an anti-inflammatory. == References =="

It is also present in parts of Tanzania, where it is considered an invasive species. Because its fruit explodes when ripe, it has also received the colloquial nickname \"dynamite tree\".The sandbox tree can grow to 60 metres (200 ft) in height, and up to 13.2 metres (43 ft) in girth at 1.8 m (6 ft) above the ground; its large ovate leaves grow to 60 cm (2 ft) wide. The trees are monoecious, with red, un-petaled flowers. Male flowers grow on long spikes, while female flowers grow alone in leaf axils. The trunk is covered in long, sharp spikes that secrete poisonous sap. The fruit are large, pumpkin-shaped capsules, 3–5 cm (1–2 in) long, 5–8 cm (2–3 in) diameter, with 16 carpels arranged radially. Its seeds are flattened and about 2 cm (3⁄4 in) diameter. The capsules explode when ripe, splitting into segments and launching seeds at 70 m/s (250 km/h; 160 mph). One source states that ripe capsules catapult their seeds as far as 100 m (330 ft). Another source states that seeds are thrown as far as 45 m (150 ft) from a tree, most commonly 30 m (100 ft). High-speed video analysis of its exploding fruit revealed that sandbox seeds fly with backspin as opposed to topspin, which had been previously assumed. Backspin helps "

It is a large, erect deciduous shrub growing to 3 m (10 ft) tall and wide, with broadly oval leaves and dense branches. The flowers are typically borne in large flat heads in late summer, and are in variable shades of pale blue and pink, fringed by white or pale pink sterile florets. The Latin aspera means \"rough-textured\" and refers to the downy lower surface of the leaves. Due to how highly cultivated Hydrangea aspera is, coupled with the extensive species range, the related taxonomy of subspecies and potential synonyms is uncertain.Hydrangea aspera has lace capped, flat-topped inflorescences with flowers that vary in color based on the pH level of the soil. The sterile flowers of this species have longer sepals than those of the fertile flowers. Plants that grow in more acidic soil have flowers that are various shades of blue. The lower the pH level is, the more vibrant or pigmented the blue color appears. At higher or more alkaline pH levels, the flowers are various shades of pink. In addition to the pH level of the soil, the amount of soluble aluminum available in the soil also affects the flower color. When a plant is able to absorb more aluminum ions, the flower color is found to be more blue.

A closely related hydrangea from the mountains of the interior of Japan, Hydrangea serrata, was treated as a variety of H. macrophylla by some authors in the past, but is currently treated as a separate species. The species is naturalised in China, Korea, Siberia, New Zealand and the Americas, and has become an invasive species in the Azores and Madeira archipelagos.

    "knowledge_text": "Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger, also black henbane and stinking nightshade) is a poisonous plant belonging to tribe Hyoscyameae of the nightshade family Solanaceae. Henbane is native to temperate Europe and Siberia, and naturalised in Great Britain and Ireland.The name henbane dates from AD 1265; \"bane\" meant 'thing that causes death'. Other etymologies of henbane derive from the Indo-European stem bhelena meaning \"crazy plant\" and with the Proto-Germanic element bil meaning \"vision\", \"hallucination\", \"magical power\", and \"miraculous ability\". Historically, henbane was used in combination with other plants, such as the mandrake, the deadly nightshade, and datura, as an anaesthetic potion, and for its psychoactive properties in \"magic brews\". These psychoactive properties include visual hallucinations and a sensation of flight. It was originally used in continental Europe, Asia, and the Arab world, though it did spread to England in the Middle Ages. The use of henbane by the ancient Romans was documented by Pliny, who said it was \"of the nature of wine and therefore offensive to the understanding\", and by Dioscorides, who recommended it as a sedative and analgesic. The plant, recorded as Herba Apollinaris, was used to yield oracles by the priestesses of Apollo. Recently evidence for its use in the earlier British Neolithic has been debated. John Gerard's Herball states: \"The leaves, the seeds and the juice, when taken internally cause an unquiet sleep, like unto the sleep of drunke"

H. perforatum is the type species of its genus, known for its historical use in folklore and traditional medicine. Probably a hybrid between the closely related H. attenuatum and H. maculatum (imperforate St. John's wort) that originated in Siberia, the species has spread worldwide. It can further hybridize with related species due to its allopolyploid nature. It is native to much of Europe, West and Central Asia, and parts of Africa and China and has been widely introduced elsewhere, thriving in well-drained, temperate habitats such as meadows, hillsides, and open woods with moderate rainfall and mild temperatures. It is a resilient, toxic, and invasive plant that reproduces sexually and vegetatively, supports specialized insect herbivores, suffers from plant diseases, and poses ecological and agricultural threats in many parts of the world.

The genus is the largest of the Hypoxidaceae and has its centre of variation in South Africa, where it occurs in open undisturbed grasslands. The name Hypoxis was taken over by Linnaeus in 1759 from a name coined by Paul Reneaulme in 1611 for a superficially similar species of Gagea and meaning \"a little sour\", referring to the taste of that plant's leaves.These plants are perennial herbs with corms or rhizomes. Some have tubers. The aboveground herbage is a layered cluster of lance-shaped, linear, or hairlike leaves, sometimes sheathed together at the bases. The blades are usually at least slightly hairy. The flowers are borne on a short, stemlike scape in a raceme or umbel arrangement, or sometimes singly. The flower has six yellow tepals which may be hairy, especially on the undersides. The undersides may also be whitish or tinged green or red. Occasional flowers have 4 or 8 tepals. The fruit is a capsule with a few to many small, oily seeds. The seeds are needed to identify many species. Most have seeds less than 2 millimeters long, so microscopic examination is required. Hypoxis plants have long pl"

The stem is woody at the base, from which grow a number of upright branches. Its leaves are lanceolate, dark green, and from 2 to 2.5 cm (3⁄4 to 1 in) long. During the summer, hyssop produces pink, blue (ssp. aristadus), or, more rarely, white fragrant (ssp. f. albus) flowers. These give rise to small oblong tetra-achenes.

Both the plant and the beverage contain caffeine. The indigenous Guaraní and some Tupi communities (whose territory covered present-day Paraguay) first cultivated and consumed yerba mate prior to European colonization of the Americas. Its consumption was exclusive to the natives of only two regions of the territory that today is Paraguay, more specifically the departments of Amambay and Alto Paraná. After the Jesuits discovered its commercialization potential, yerba mate became widespread throughout the province and even elsewhere in the Spanish Crown. Mate is traditionally consumed in central and southern regions of South America, primarily in Paraguay, as well as in Argentina, Uruguay, Southern Brazil, the Gran Chaco of Bolivia, and Southern Chile. It has also become popular in the Druze and Alawite community in the Levant, especially in Syria and Lebanon, where it is imported from Paraguay and Argentina, thanks to 19th-century Syrian immigrants to Argentina.

As a rule-of-thumb, \"jewelweed\" is used exclusively for Nearctic species, and balsam is usually applied to tropical species. In the British Isles by far the most common names are impatiens and busy lizzie, especially for the many varieties, hybrids and cultivars involving Impatiens walleriana. \"Busy lizzie\" is also found in the American literature. Impatiens glandulifera is commonly called policeman's helmet in the UK, where it is an introduced species.Most Impatiens species are herbaceous annuals or perennials with succulent stems. Only a few woody species exist. Plant size varies, from five centimeters to 2.5 meters, depending on the species. Stems often form roots when they come into contact with the soil. The leaves are entire, often dentate or sinuate with extrafloral nectaries. Depending on the species, leaves can be thin to succulent. Particularly on the underside of the leaves, tiny air bubbles are trapped over and under the leaf surface, giving them a silvery sheen that becomes pronounced when they are held underwater.

It may be an annual, biennial, or perennial, depending on the climate in which it is grown. It has light green pinnate leaves and sheafs of pink or violet flowers. The rotenoids deguelin, dehydrodeguelin, rotenol, rotenone, tephrosin and sumatrol can be found in I. tinctoria. The native range of this species is tropical West Africa, Tanzania to South Africa and the Indian subcontinent to Mainland Southeast Asia. The plant is a legume, so it is rotated into fields to improve the soil in the same way that other legume crops such as alfalfa and beans are. The plant is also widely grown as a soil-improving groundcover. Dye is obtained from the processing of the plant's leaves. They are soaked in water and fermented in order to convert the glycoside indican naturally present in the plant to the blue dye indigotin. The precipitate from the fermented leaf solution is mixed with a strong base such as lye. Today most dye is synthetic, but natural dye from I. tinctoria is still available, marketed as natural colouring where it is known as tarum in Indonesia and nila in Malaysia. In Iran and areas of the former Soviet Union it is known as basma. Marco Polo (13th century) was the first European to report on the preparation of indigo in India.

It is a classified as an invasive species in California, and a potential threat to wine production in the state. The plant is a branching subshrub growing up to 130 centimetres (51 inches) tall, with an aromatic, camphor smell. Leaves are long and narrow, pointed at each end, with small teeth along the edges, glandular hairs on the surfaces, and a sticky resin. One plant can produce numerous yellow flower heads with as many as 16 ray florets and 40 disc florets. Barbs on the fluffy-tipped seeds, which help it spread, can fatally damage the digestive systems of grazing animals. Oils in the plant also taint the flavor of meat and milk of animals that have consumed them. The sticky resin has been known to cause allergic reactions and severe dermatitis in humans. For this reasons, it is advisable to wear protective gloves when handling the plant.

They carry yellow daisy-like composite flowerheads often with narrow ray-florets. Some common characteristics include pappus with bristles, flat capitulum, and lack of chaff. Several species are popular flowers for the garden, with cultivation going back to antiquity. The smaller species are used in rock gardens and the more common larger ones, which tend to have very coarse foliage, in borders.The genus name Inula is of uncertain origin, and was already in use by the Romans. The Latin phrase inula campana (field inula) gave rise to the English elecampane whose scientific name is Inula helenium. The plant's specific name, helenium, derives from Helen of Troy; elecampane is said to have sprung up from where her tears fell.

It grows abundantly near waterways and requires little to no care.Ipomoea aquatica grows in water or on moist soil. Its stems are 2–3 metres (7–10 ft) or longer, rooting at the nodes. The hollow cavity within the stem makes the plant buoyant. The leaves vary from typically sagittate (arrowhead-shaped) to lanceolate, 5–15 cm (2–6 in) long and 2–8 cm (0.8–3 in) broad. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 3–5 cm (1–2 in) in diameter, and usually white in colour with a mauve centre. Propagation is either by planting cuttings of the stem shoots, which will root along nodes, or by planting the seeds from flowers that produce seed pods. Ipomoea aquatica is most widely known as kangkong (also spelled kangkung), its common name in Maritime Southeast Asia, which likely originates from either Malay or one of the languages of the Philippines.

Its sizeable, starchy, sweet-tasting tuberous roots are used as a root vegetable, which is a staple food in parts of the world. Cultivars of the sweet potato have been bred to bear tubers with flesh and skin of various colors. Moreover, the young shoots and leaves are occasionally eaten as greens. The sweet potato and the potato are only distantly related, both being in the order Solanales. Although darker sweet potatoes are often known as yams in parts of North America, they are even more distant from actual yams, which are monocots in the order Dioscoreales. The sweet potato is native to the tropical regions of South America in present-day Ecuador. Of the approximately 50 genera and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae, I. batatas is the only crop plant of major importance—some others are used locally (e.g., I. aquatica 'kangkong' as a green vegetable), but many are poisonous. The genus Ipomoea that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called morning glories, but that term is not usually extended to I. batatas. Some cultivars of I. batatas are grown as ornamental plants under the name tuberous morning glory and used in a horticultural context. Sweet potatoes can also be called yams in North America.

A species of morning glory, it has many common names, including mile-a-minute vine, Messina creeper, Cairo morning glory, coast morning glory and railroad creeper. The species name cairica translates to \"from Cairo\", the city where this species was first collected.A hairless, slim climber with bulbous roots and lignescented base, its leaves are stalked with 2 to 6 cm long petioles. The leaf blade is ovate to circular in outline, 3 to 10 cm long and 6 to 9 cm wide. It is divided into five to seven segments, these are lanceolate, ovate or elliptic, entire and pointed at the tip and base. Often pseudo side-leaves are formed. The lavender-coloured inflorescences are one to a cyme. The flower stalks are 12 to 20 mm long, the sepals are 6 to 8 mm long, ovate and sting-pointed. The crown is funnel-shaped, 4 to 6 cm long and violet colored. The stamens and the stylus do not protrude beyond the crown. The ovary is hairless. The fruits are spherical capsules approximately 1 cm in diameter containing one or two hairy seeds. Each fruit matures at about 1 cm across and contains hairy seeds. The vine blooms occasionally throughout the months, but more profusely from spring to summer. Its exact native range is uncertain, though it is believed to originate from a rather wide area, ranging from Cape Verde to the Arabian Peninsula, including northern Africa, tropical Africa "

Their most widespread common name is morning glory, but some species in related genera bear that same common name and some Ipomoea species are known by different common names. Those formerly separated in Calonyction (Greek καλός kalós \"good\" and νύξ, νυκτός núx, nuktós, \"night\") are called moonflowers.

    "knowledge_text": "Ipomoea violacea is a perennial species of Ipomoea that occurs throughout the world with the exception of the European continent. It is most commonly called beach moonflower or sea moonflower as the flowers open at night.The corolla of the flower of Ipomoea violacea is white, distinguishing this species from Ipomoea tricolor, commonly called Heavenly Blue. It is sometimes mistaken for the cultivar Pearly Gates, the corolla of which is also white, probably because of its misleading Latin binomial name, Ipomoea violacea, \"violacea\" meaning purple. A comparison of the taxonomy of the two plants shows that they belong to different Subgenera, consequently, Ipomoea violacea should not be used as a synonym for Ipomoea tricolor. In exceptional cases where Ipomoea violacea has to be used as a synonym of Ipomoea tricolor, one must specify the incorrect usage by using the abbreviation 'Auct.' for Auctorum. Ipomoea violacea: Genus: Ipomoea Subgenus: Eriospermum Section: Erpipomoea Ipomoea tricolor: Genus: Ipomoea Subgenus: Quamoclit Section: Tricolor Ipomoea violacea is no longer a synonym for Ipomoea tricolor. Ipomoea tricolor contains ergolines, along with 24 other Ipomoeas, but I. violacea is not among them.  Dressler, S.; Schmidt, M. & Zizka, G. (2014). \"Ipomoea violacea\".

It has 3-5-stems and 8–14 leaves per stem growing in a fan, with flowers ascending proximally having orange-red scattered spots of darker pigment, blooming during summer. The seed pods open in the fall, showing clusters of black, shiny seeds whose resemblance to those of a blackberry gives the plant its common name, \"blackberry lily\". The plant is hardy to USDA plant hardiness zone 5 and is propagated by seeds or division. In the wild, it grows in grasslands, pastures, forest clearings, meadows, and mountainous regions or shrublands. Although it has escaped cultivation in many regions, it is not considered to have potential as an invasive species. Its synonyms are Epidendrum domesticum L., Vanilla domestica (L.)

The species is critically endangered in its native Madeira. Reports of remaining populations vary between 6 and 50 individual plants in two separate areas, Funchal and Ribeira Brava. Jasminum azoricum, which does not tolerate freezing temperatures, has long been in cultivation in Europe as a greenhouse plant with records in Netherlands since 1693 and England from about 1724. It has been prized for its bright evergreen foliage, long flowering period and scented blooms. Plants are readily propagated from cuttings and by layering. The species prefers a sunny, frost-free position with support from structures such as fences or posts. In the UK this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

It is held to be especially sacred to Vishnu. In Manipur, Kundo flowers are used in worship, and are an essential part of a marriage ceremony. The bride garlands the groom with two Kundo flower garlands. The groom then takes one of the two and garlands the bride.Jasminum multiflorum is native to India, Nepal, Bhutan, Laos, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. While Jasmine flowers are known for its attractive and intensely fragrant flower, this species does not have any scent.

It contains isoquinoline alkaloids and is used mainly as a bitter tonic especially in cases of anorexia nervosa. It contains no tannins, hence it can be safely used in iron preparations for the treatment of anaemia without the fear of precipitation resulted from in vitro interaction.Tall, dioecious twining perennial vine; often reaching the tops of trees. The annual stems, one or two from each root, have hairs with glandular tips and have large bright green membranous leaves which are palmate, alternate and long petioled. The flowers are insignificant and greenish white. The female flower is followed by moon-shaped stone in a drupe. Male flowers are in 30 centimetres (12 in) long panicles. The tuberous root is large and fleshy, about 3–8 centimetres (1.2–3.1 in) in diameter with a thick bark. Transverse section is yellowish, outside greyish brown. Taste is muscilagenous and very bitter.  Dressler, S.; Schmidt, M. & Zizka, G. (2014). \"Jateorhiza palmata\". African plants – a Photo Guide. Frankfurt/Main: Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg."

It has been spread to tropical and subtropical regions around the world, becoming naturalized or invasive in many areas. The specific epithet, \"curcas\", was first used by Portuguese doc Garcia de Orta more than 400 years ago. Common names in English include physic nut, Barbados nut, poison nut, bubble bush or purging nut. In parts of Africa and areas in Asia such as India it is often known as \"castor oil plant\" or \"hedge castor oil plant\", but it is not the same as the castor oil plant, Ricinus communis. Jatropha curcas is a semi-evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching a height of 6 metres (20 feet) or more. It is resistant to a high degree of aridity, allowing it to grow in deserts. It contains phorbol esters, which are considered toxic. However, edible (non-toxic) varieties native to Mexico also exist, known by the local population as piñón manso, xuta, chutacurcaste, among others. J. curcas also contains compounds such as trypsin inhibitors, phytate, saponins and a type of lectin known as curcin. The seeds contain 27–40% oil (average: 34.4%) that can be processed to produce a high-quality biodiesel fuel, usable in a standard diesel engine. The oil is a strong laxative.

The species has numerous cultivars which produce the edible walnut consumed around the world and produced predominately in China. It is widely cultivated across temperate regions throughout the world including those of Eurasia, Australia, and the Americas.The genus name, Juglans, is derived from two Latin words, jovis, which means Jupiter, the chief god of the ancient Roman religion; and glans meaning an acorn or nut. The specific epithet, regia, is defined as regal or royal in references the quality of the fruit and edible nuts. Juglans regia is a large deciduous tree, attaining heights of 10–25 metres (35–80 feet), and a trunk up to 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) in diameter, commonly with a short trunk and broad crown. The tallest accurately measured specimen is in the Lagodekhi Protected Areas of the country of Georgia, 29 m (95 ft) tall, and the stoutest in Spain, 9 m (30 ft) in girth. Heights of 34 m in the wild in Kyrgyzstan and 32 m in cultivation in Britain have been reported, but not verified.

Common names include papyrus sedges, flatsedges, nutsedges, umbrella-sedges, galingales, and zozoro (from Malagasy). The stems are circular in cross-section in some, triangular in others, usually leafless for most of their length, with the slender grass-like leaves at the base of the plant, and in a whorl at the apex of the flowering stems. The flowers are greenish and wind-pollinated; they are produced in clusters among the apical leaves. The seed is a small nutlet. Cyperus species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chedra microstigma. They also provide an alternative food source for Bicyclus anynana larvae. The seeds and tubers are an important food for many small birds and mammals. Cyperus microcristatus (from Cameroon) and C. multifolius (native to Panama and Ecuador) are possibly extinct; the former was only found once, in 1995, and the latter has not been seen in the last 200 years.

It has naturalized in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and various oceanic islands. It grows in wet areas, such as wetlands, riparian areas, and marshes with sandy and peaty substrates. It is common throughout the British Isles by rivers, streams and lakes, in wet heathland and pastures, including purple moor-grass and rush pastures and fen-meadow plant associations. Juncus effusus grows in large clumps up to about 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) tall. The stems are smooth cylinders with light pith filling. The yellowish inflorescence appears to emerge from one side of the stem about 20 centimetres (8 in) from the top. In fact the stem ends there; the top part is the bract, that continues with only a slight colour-band marking it from the stem.

It has needle-like leaves in whorls of three; the leaves are green, with a single white stomatal band on the inner surface. It never attains the scale-like adult foliage of other members of the genus. It is dioecious, with male and female cones on separate plants so requiring wind pollination to transfer pollen from male to female cones. Male trees or shrubs naturally live longer than female trees or shrubs; a male tree or shrub can live more than 2000 years. The male cones are yellow, 2–3 millimetres (3⁄32–1⁄8 in) long, and fall soon after shedding their pollen in March–April. The fruit are berry-like cones known as juniper berries. They are initially green, ripening in 18 months to purple-black with a blue waxy coating; they are spherical, 4–12 mm (5⁄32–15⁄32 in) diameter, and usually have three (occasionally six) fleshy fused scales, each scale with a single seed.

    "knowledge_text": "Juniperus recurva, commonly named the Himalayan juniper or drooping juniper, is a juniper native to the Himalaya, from northern Pakistan, through India, Nepal and Bhutan, to western Yunnan in southwestern China. It grows at altitudes of 3,000–4,000 metres (9,800–13,100 feet).Juniperus recurva is a large shrub or tree reaching 6–20 metres (20–66 feet) tall (rarely 25 m), with a trunk up to 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) in diameter and a broadly conical to rounded or irregular crown. The leaves are needle-like, 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 inch) long, arranged in six ranks in alternating whorls of three. The cones are berry-like, globose to ovoid, 5–10 mm long and 4–7 mm diameter, glossy blue-black, and contain one seed; they are mature in about 18 months. The male cones are 3–4 mm long, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is largely monoecious with pollen and seed cones produced on the same plants. There are two varieties, treated as distinct species by some botanists: Juniperus recurva var. recurva - leaves mostly 5–8 mm. Throughout the range. Juniperus recurva var. coxii - leaves mostly 7–10 mm. Confined to the eastern Himalaya on high rainfall sites. Juniperus recurva is planted as an ornamental tree in western Europe, valued for its drooping foliage, particularly pendulous in the cultivar 'Castlewellan'.

    "knowledge_text": "The Cardueae are a tribe of flowering plants in the daisy family (Asteraceae) and the subfamily Carduoideae. Most of them are commonly known as thistles; four of the best known genera are Carduus, Cynara (containing the widely eaten artichoke), Cirsium, and Onopordum. They are annual, biennial, or perennial herbs. Many species are thorny on leaves, stems, or involucre, and some have laticifers or resin conduits. Almost 80 genera comprising 2500 species are assigned to this tribe, native of temperate regions of Europe and Asia (especially the Mediterranean region and Minor Asia), Australia and tropical Africa; only three genera contain species native to the Americas.The correct name for the tribe has been disputed. In 1806, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Augustin Pyramus de Candolle published the name Cynarocephalae. This is a descriptive name, referring to the bluish colour of the flower heads. Such descriptive names for tribes are not valid under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, which requires them to be based on a generic name. The name has been corrected by some authors to Cynareae, but this was not the name that was published in 1806. Christian Friedrich Lessing published Cynareae in 1830, but Henri Cassini had already published Cardueae in 1819, and as Lessing included Carduus in Cynareae, his name was superfluous. Some authors have divided the plants traditionally held to be in this tribe into three tribes: Cynareae in the narrow sense, Ca"

The plant's native range is Afghanistan, the Indian subcontinent (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka), Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. It has been introduced elsewhere. It is used as a traditional medicinal plant.Justicia adhatoda is a shrub with 10-20 lance-shaped leaves 8-9 centimeters in length by four wide. They are oppositely arranged, smooth-edged, and borne on short petioles. When dry they are of a dull brownish-green colour. They are bitter-tasting. When a leaf is cleared with chloral hydrate and examined microscopically the oval stomata can be seen. They are surrounded by two crescent-shaped cells at right angles to the ostiole. The epidermis bears simple one- to three-celled warty hairs, and small glandular hairs. Cystoliths occur beneath the epidermis of the underside of the blade. The trunk has many long opposite ascending branches, where the bark is yellowish in color. Flowers are usually white and the inflorescence shows large, dense, axillary spikes. Fruits are pubescent, and are with club-shaped capsules. The leaves of Justicia adhatoda contains phytochemicals such as alkaloids, tannins, saponins, phenolics and flavonoids.

The plant is groomed in small herbal nurseries for applications in medicine preparation. As its Sanskrit name bhumi champa (bloom from within earth) implies, the indigo-coloured flower shoots from within the soil. In fact, the flower emerges much in advance of the whitish leafy shoot.

Shiva-Mukha (Face of Shiva), Shivana-Moogu (Nose of Shiva) or Shivana-Mogge (Flowers to be offered to Shiva) can be the origins of the name \"Shivamogga\".

He used to boil sweet herbs in an earthen pot. Some cowherds, found this pot and after tasting the sweet beverage named this place Sihi-Moge.

    "knowledge_text": "Bassia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. They are distributed in the western Mediterranean to eastern Asia. Some occur outside their native ranges as introduced species.The species of genus Bassia are annuals or perennial subshrubs. Their leaves are variable. The flowers are normally inconspicuous, in spike-like inflorescences without bracteoles. The fruits are achenes. The seed contains an annular, horseshoe-shaped or folded embryo that surrounds the perisperm. The fruiting perianth remains either unappendaged or develops 5 wings. The wings are spiny in Bassia hyssopifolia. According to its most recent description, the genus is defined by its three types of C4 \"kochioid\" leaf anatomy. Many other characters cannot be used to differentiate species from one another, because they are variable among individuals within the species. The genus mainly occurs in steppe and desert ecosystems. Some species can be found in ruderal sites and salt marshes up to subalpine altitudes. Phylogenetical research suggests that the genus evolved in the Miocene. Some palatable species of Bassia with high protein content are valuable components of rangelands, sometimes seeded for the melioration of overgrazed rangelands. The genus name Bassia was first published in 1766 by Carlo Allioni, with the type species Bassia muricata L. (under the name B. aegyptiaca).

Its common names include summer cypress, mock-cypress, kochia, belvedere, World's Fair plant, burningbush, Mexican firebrush, and Mexican fireweed, the provenance of the latter three names being the herb's red autumn foliage.The fruit of Bassia scoparia with the calyx attached is dull brown, but when hulled, it reveals dull black seeds, or dark to blackish-brown seeds in some escaped regions, such as Europe. The seeds are dispersed by wind and water and are transported when the whole plant detaches and rolls on the wind as a tumbleweed. The seed does not persist in the soil seed bank, dying within about a year if it fails to germinate. The species is a C4 plant, specifically of the NADP-ME type. It develops herbicide resistance unusually quickly, and quadruple-resistant populations have developed in North America. Bassia scoparia is native to a region ranging from Central Europe to Asia and is now widespread throughout the world. While having a variety of beneficial uses, it is also considered an invasive weed. The species was first published in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who named it Chenopodium scoparium. In 1809, it was placed in the genus Kochia by Heinrich Schrader. It was transferred to Bassia in 1978 by Andrew J. Scott. Kochia was included in Bassia in "

Leaves often are purple on the lower surface, up to 28 cm (11 in) long and 11 cm (4.3 in) wide, and have margins which are shallowly to deeply toothed. Leaf tips taper to a slender point, and the bases taper to the stem forming a \"winged\" petiole. Flowering heads appear alone or as a few in a cluster on a short peduncle. Each head contains 15-35 reduced flowers known as florets, which have to pale to bright yellow corollas up to 9 mm (0.35 in) long.

In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. In 2023, world production of lettuce (and chicory) was 28 million tonnes, led by China with 53% of the total. Lettuce was originally farmed by the ancient Egyptians, who transformed it from a plant whose seeds were used to obtain oil into an important food crop raised for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans; the latter gave it the name lactuca, from which the English lettuce is derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century, cultivars were described that can still be found in modern gardens.

Rounder varieties are typically called calabash gourds (L. s. var. depressa) . Calabash gourds can grow to great size. One grown in Taylorsvlle, Kentucky in 2001 weighed 111.5 kg (246 lb). The gourd was one of the world's first cultivated plants grown not primarily for food, but for use as containers. The bottle gourd may have been carried from Asia to Africa, Europe, and the Americas in the course of human migration, or by seeds floating across the oceans inside the gourd. It has been proven to have been globally domesticated (and existed in the New World) during the Pre-Columbian era. There is sometimes confusion when discussing \"calabash\" because the name is shared with the unrelated calabash tree (Cresce"

It is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 35 cm tall, with leaves 7–16 cm long and 1–3.7 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin. The five-petaled white flower has a slender floral tube only 2 or 3 mm (0.1 or 0.1 in) wide by 7 to 8 cm (2.8 to 3.1 in) in length. The plant contains two pyridine alkaloids, lobeline and nicotine. The effects of nicotine and lobeline are quite similar, with psychoactive effects at small dosages and with unpleasant effects including vomiting, muscle paralysis, and trembling at higher dosages. For this reason, H. longiflora (and its various synonyms) is often referenced for both its toxicity and its ethnobotanical uses.Media related to Hippobroma longiflora at Wikimedia Commons"

Lavender is found on the Iberian Peninsula and around the entirety of the Mediterranean coastline (including the Adriatic coast, the Balkans, the Levant, and coastal North Africa), in parts of Eastern and Southern Africa and the Middle East, as well as in South Asia and on the Indian subcontinent. Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils. Lavender is used in traditional medicine and as an ingredient in cosmetics.The genus includes annual or short-lived herbaceous perennial plants and shrub-like perennials, subshrubs or small shrubs. Leaf shape is diverse across the genus. They are simple in some commonly cultivated species; in other species, they are pinnately toothed, or pinnate, sometimes multiple pinnate and dissected. In most species, the leaves are covered in fine hairs or indumentum, which normally contain essential oils. Flowers are contained in whorls, held on spikes rising above the foliage, with the spikes being branched in some species. Some species produce colored bracts at the tips of the inflorescences. The flowers may be blue, viole"

In 1775 he published the first volume of his \"Portraits of Rare Plants\" (Dutch: Afbeeldingen van zeldzame gewassen), which was followed by four other volumes, of which in 1780 the latter was published. The volumes contain 50 engravings, which he made of plants from the Hortus botanicus Leiden and butterflies. In 1789 he published Plantae rariores vivis coloribus depictae, a full Latin version of his earlier work with 55 color plates and four extra pages of text and also published Plantarum selectarum icones pictae with 28 color images .

Lion's tail is also a common name for Leonotis leonurus, and lion's ear, a common name for Leonotis nepetifolia. Originally from Central Asia and southeastern Europe, it is now found worldwide, spread largely due to its use as a herbal remedy.Leonurus cardiaca has a squarish stem which is clad in short hairs and is often purplish, especially near the nodes. The opposite leaves have serrated margins and are palmately lobed with long petioles; basal leaves are wedge shaped with three points while the upper leaves have three to five. They are slightly hairy above and greyish beneath. Flowers appear in leaf axils on the upper part of the plant and have three-lobed bracts. The calyx of each flower is bell-shaped and has five lobes. The corolla is irregular, 8 to 12 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long, fused, long-tubed with two lips. The upper lip is convex and covered with white hairs and the lower lip is three-lobed and downward-curving and spotted with red. The flowers are pink to lilac in colour often with furry lower lips. There are four protruding stamens, two short and two longer, and the fruit is a four-chambered schizocarp. The plant grows to about 60 to 100 cm (24 to 39 in) in height and blooms in mid to late summer. Motherwort is probably native to the southeastern part of Europe and central Asia where it has bee"

It has verticillaster inflorescence. It is naturalized in many other parts of the world, including South, Central and North Americas.Leonurus sibiricus is an herbaceous annual or biennial with upright stems that grow from 20–80 cm (8–30 in) tall. Plants have long petioled basal leaves that are ovate-cordate in shape. The leaves have toothed margins and are incised with deeply cut lobes. Typically one or a few flowering stems are produced from short tap-roots. The lower stem leaves are deciduous and wither away as the plants begin blooming. The petioles of the leaves, midway up the stems are 2 cm (0.79 in) long. The flowers are produced in many flowered verticillasters, produced in whorls around the top half or more of the stem. The flowers are sessile with 8 mm (0.31 in) long calices that are tubular-campanulate in shape. The corolla is white or reddish to purple-red, with an upper lip that is oblong in shape and longer than the lower lip. When flowering is done, brown oblong shaped nutlets are produced in good number. Blooming occurs from July into late September, but flowering can occur year-round when climate permits. This species' habitat within its natural range is stony or sandy grasslands or pine forests. Alkaloids isolated from the plant include: Cycloleonurinine Leoheterin Leonurine Leonurinine Leuronurine Prehispanolone Preleoh"

It has numerous woody stems, alternating waxy leaves and clusters of small white flowers. It produces small (1.6 mm) fruits which each contain two reddish seeds. It has an extensive root network, known to reach 9 ft (2.7 m) in depth, and constituting 40% of the total biomass of the plant. This plant is native to southern Europe, Mediterranean countries and Asia as far east as the Himalayas. It is an introduced species in Australia and North America, growing throughout the United States and Mexico. It may have been introduced to the U.S. when its seed got into a shipment of sugar beet seeds. The plant is most invasive in wetland habitats, including riparian zones; from there it easily spreads to other ecosystems, such as sagebrush. It is perceived as a threat to salt marshes in southern New Hampshire, prompting the Department of Environmental Services and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to look for it in the Hampton–Seabrook Estuary in 2008, where it is thought to have spread. The agencies were recruiting volunteers to help look for and properly remove it from this area. It is also a pest in the Monte Vista and Alamosa National Wildlife"

Garden cress is genetically related to watercress and mustard, sharing their peppery, tangy flavour and aroma. In some regions, garden cress is known as mustard and cress, garden pepper cress, pepperwort, pepper grass, or poor man's pepper. This annual plant can reach a height of 60 cm (24 in), with many branches on the upper part. The white to pinkish flowers are only 2 mm (1⁄16 in) across, clustered in small branched racemes. When consumed raw, cress is a high-nutrient food containing substantial content of vitamins A, C and K and several dietary minerals.Cultivation of cress is practical both on mass scales and on the individual scale. Garden cress is suitable for hydroponic cultivation and thrives in slightly alkaline water. In many local markets, the demand for hydroponically grown cress can exceed available supply, partially because cress leaves are not suitable for distribution in dried form, so they can only be partially preserved. Consumers commonly acquire cress as seeds or (in Europe) from markets as boxes of young live shoots. Edible shoots are typically harvested in one to two weeks after planting, when they are 5–13 cm (2–5 in) tall. Garden cress is added to soups, sandwiches and salads for its tangy flavour.

A monotypic species is one that does not include subspecies or smaller, infraspecific taxa. In the case of genera, the term \"unispecific\" or \"monospecific\" is sometimes preferred. In botanical nomenclature, a monotypic genus is a genus in the special case in which a genus and a single species are simultaneously described.Monotypic taxa present several important theoretical challenges in biological classification. One key issue is known as \"Gregg's Paradox\": if a single species is the only member of multiple hierarchical levels (for example, being the only species in its genus, which is the only genus in its family), then each level needs a distinct definition to maintain logical structure. Otherwise, the different taxonomic ranks become effectively identical, which creates problems for organizing biological diversity in a hierarchical system. When taxonomists identify a monotypic taxon, this often reflects uncertainty about its relationships rather than true evolutionary isolation. This uncertainty is evident in many cases across different species. For instance, the diatom Licmophora juergensii is placed in a monotypic genus because scientists have not yet found clear evidence of its relationships to other species. Some taxonomists argue against monotypic taxa because they reduce the information content of biological classifications. As taxonomists Backlund and Bre"

It is native to tropical Asia.The plant grows to a height of up to 120 cm (47 in). Stipules are absent, the taproot is white or brown, and the stem is quadrangular. Sub-sessile leaves are linear-lanceolate or elliptic-lanceolate, 2.5–7.5 cm (0.98–2.95 in) long, not lobed or divided, blunt at the tip, obtuse, entire or cerrulate, glandular, hispid and coarsely dentate at the margins. Whorls of many flowers are bisexual, sessile or sub-sessile, usually in terminal whorls 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) in diameter, grouped together in an axillary, corolla white in color and 2 cm long. Calyx is 5–7 mm (0.20–0.28 in) long, and obliquely turbinate, with minute teeth, apex acute, base acute, pinnately veined, erect or spreading horizontally. It is reproduced by seed and pollinated by bees moths and flies. Leucas belongs to the subfamily Lamioideae, and is closely related to the small genera Acrotome and Leonotis. Plant occurs in various habitats, a weed of sunny dry localities, often on sandy soils, paddy dams, waste places, open grasslands, road-sides from the lowland up to 1,700 m (5,600 ft) in altitude. It is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, but is rather rare in East Asia. A decoction of the herb prepared by boiling with a soda solution emits a strong odor; when condensed, the v"

The flower colour is typically a pink-purple, with dark spots, but is quite variable, extending from near white to near black. The flowers are scented. Numerous flowers are borne on each plant, and up to 50 can be found on vigorous plants. The green stems can be flushed with purple or red and the leaves are elliptic to inverse lanceolate, mostly in whorls, up to 16 centimetres (6.3 in) long and often lightly hairy underneath. Numerous names have been proposed at the levels of subspecies and varieties. Only two are recognized by the World Checklist.

This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Lilium martagon was used in hybridising with L. hansonii at the end of the 19th century by Mrs RO Backhouse of Hereford, England. The name Turk's cap lily, also applied to a number of other species, comes from the characteristic reflexed shape of the petals. The specific epithet martagon is of uncertain origin.

It is widely planted as an ornamental because of its showy orange-and-black flowers, and sporadically occurs as a garden escapee in North America, particularly the eastern United States including New England, and has made incursions into some southern states such as Georgia. It has the English name tiger lily, but that name has been applied to other species as well.Like other true lilies, the flowers are borne on upright stems that are 80–200 centimetres (31–79 inches) tall and bear lanceolate leaves 6–10 cm (2+1⁄2–4 in) long and 1–2 cm (3⁄8–3⁄4 in) broad. L. lancifolium produces aerial bulblets, known as bulbils, in the leaf axils. These bulbils are uncommon in Lilium species and they produce new plants that are clones of the original plant. The flowers are odorless. Each lasts a few days and if pollinated produce capsules with many thin seeds. Extrafloral nectaries on the species were first noted by Zimmerman 1932. These lilies are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction, dependent on the cytotype. Some populations of the plant are diploid (have two copies of their chromosomes) and some populations are triploid (have three copies of their chromosomes). The North American population is mainly triploid, while the Asian populations may be either. The diploid populations can undergo both forms of reproduction. The triploid populations, however, are"

It is native to Southeast Asia, where it flourishes in hot temperatures and grows most often in watery environments, particularly in flooded rice fields. It is called ngò ôm or ngò om or ngổ in Vietnam and used as an herb and also cultivated for use as an aquarium plant. The plant was introduced to North America in the 1970s due to Vietnamese immigration following the Vietnam War. It is called \"ma om\" (ម្អម) in Khmer. It is used in traditional Cambodian soup dishes and Southern Vietnamese cuisine. It can grow in flooded rice paddies during wet season but it grows best on drained but still wet sandy soil of harvested rice paddies for a few months after the rainy season ended. It dies out soon after it flowers. Rural Cambodians often harvest them and put them on the roof of their houses to dry for later use.Limnophila aromatica was formerly classified as a member of the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae, but is now classified in the plantain family, Plantaginaceae. Limnophila aromatica has a flavor and aroma reminiscent of both lemon and cumin. It is used most often in Vietnamese cuisine, where it is called ngò om. It is an ingredient in canh chua, a sweet and sour seafood soup which also includes tamarind, not to be confused with ngò gai which is also added as an accompaniment to the noodle soup called phở.

Textiles made from flax are known in English as linen and are traditionally used for bed sheets, underclothes, and table linen. Its oil is known as linseed oil. In addition to referring to the plant, the word \"flax\" may refer to the unspun fibers of the flax plant. The plant species is known only as a cultivated plant and appears to have been domesticated just once from the wild species Linum bienne, called pale flax. The plants called \"flax\" in New Zealand are, by contrast, members of the genus Phormium.Several other species in the genus Linum are similar in appearance to L. usitatissimum, cultivated flax, including some that have similar blue flowers, and others with white, yellow, or red flowers. Some of these are perennial plants, unlike L. usitatissimum, which is an annual plant. Cultivated flax plants grow to 1.2 m (4 ft) tall, with slender stems. The leaves are glaucous green, slender lanceolate, 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) long, and 3 mm broad. The flowers are 15–25 mm in diameter with five petals, which can be coloured white, blue, yellow, and red depending on the species.

It is native to eastern North America from Southern Ontario and possibly southern Quebec west to Illinois, and east to southwestern Massachusetts, then south to central Florida and Louisiana. The tulip tree is the tallest tree of the Nearctic temperate deciduous forest. It can grow to more than 50 m (160 ft) in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches 25–30 m (80–100 ft) in height, making it a very valuable timber tree. This species is also fast-growing, without the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species. In 2024 the unusual combination of rapid growth with strong wood was explained. No longer called hardwood, tulip tree lumber is now called \"midwood,\" a term created expressly for this wood. The tulip tree is the state tree of Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee.The tulip tree is one of the largest of the native trees of eastern North America, known in an extraordinary case to reach the height of 58.5 m (192 ft) with the next-tallest known specimens in the 52–54 m (170–177 ft) range.

The most common is the Indochinese lychee found in South China, Malaysia, and northern Vietnam. The other two are the Philippine lychee (locally called alupag or matamata) found only in the Philippines and the Javanese lychee cultivated in Indonesia and Malaysia. The tree has been introduced throughout Southeast Asia and South Asia. Cultivation in China is documented from the 11th century. China is the main producer of lychees, followed by India, Vietnam, other countries in Southeast Asia, other countries in South Asia, Madagascar, and South Africa. A tall evergreen tree, it bears small fleshy sweet fruits. The outside of the fruit is a pink-red, rough-textured soft shell.

The unstalked, lanceolate leaves grow up to 10 cm long and are strongly marked with lateral veins below. The greenish white, funnel-shaped flowers, appearing June – July, measure 3 – 4 mm across and are borne in short, dense cymose clusters within the leaf axils. When in fruit, the inflorescences form a V-shaped, elongated spray. The fruits comprise 4 shiny white nutlets that measure 3 – 4 mm long and persist well into winter. The plant is very widely distributed throughout Europe and Asia. It is locally common in the UK, where it is much rarer in the north and west of the country. The favoured habitat includes grassland, scrubland, and open woodland, usually on base-rich and calcareous soils. All parts of the plant have been traditionally used as a natural medicinal remedy for various ailments. In India for example, the leaves were once used as a sedative, while the seeds have been administered as a diuretic, lithotritic, febrifuge, anti-gout, anti-ovulary and anti-toxic agent as well as an anti-inflammatory for diseases of the urinary tract and for promoting digestion.

The plant stem can grow up to one meter tall, with inflorescence in the ears and purple grain. It has a cosmopolitan distribution.Darnel usually grows in the same production zones as wheat and was a serious weed of cultivation, a Vavilovian mimic of wheat, until modern sorting machinery enabled darnel seeds to be separated efficiently from seed wheat. The similarity between these two plants is so great that in some regions, darnel is called \"false wheat\". It bears a close resemblance to wheat until the ear appears. The spikes of L. temulentum are more slender than those of wheat. The spikelets are oriented edgeways to the rachis and have only a single glume, while those of wheat are oriented with the flat side to the rachis and have two glumes. Wheat will appear brown when ripe, whereas darnel is black. Darnel can be infected by an endophytic fungus of the genus Neotyphodium and the endophyte-produced, insecticidal loline alkaloids were first isolated from this plant. The French word for darnel is ivraie (from Latin ebriacus, intoxicated), which expresses the drunken nausea from eating the infected plant, which can be fatal. The French name echoes the scientific name, Latin temulentus \"drunk.\" The ancient Greek botanist Theophrastus stated in his De causis plantarum (8:7 §1) that wheat can transform (metaballein) into darnel"

It is found as far north as southern Norway, Sweden and Finland.Growing to 7 m (23 ft) or more in height, it is a vigorous deciduous twining climber, occasionally keeping its old leaves over winter. In the UK it is the only native honeysuckle. It is often found in woodland or in hedgerows or scrubland. The tubular, two-lipped flowers, creamy white or yellowish in colour, may be flushed with pink or red on the outside and in bud, and are carried in showy clusters at the ends of the shoots. The flowers are highly scented by night, much less so by day. The plant is usually pollinated by moths or long-tongued bees and develops bright red berries. Dormice make summer nests for their young from honeysuckle bark; they also eat the flowers, which are a good source of energy-rich nectar. Night-flying moths such as the hummingbird hawk-moth can detect the scent of honeysuckle flowers up to a quarter of a mile away. The clusters of red berries are eaten in the autumn by birds such as thrushes, bullfinches and warblers. Lonicera periclymenum is one of several honeysuckle species valued in the garden, for its ability to twine around other plants, or to cover unsightly walls or outbuildings; and for the intense fragrance of its profuse flowers in summer.

It is cultivated and eaten as a vegetable, but must be harvested at a young stage of development to be edible. The vegetable is popular in India, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Vietnam. When the fruit fully ripens, it becomes too fibrous for eating. The fully developed fruit is the source of the loofah scrubbing sponge. In October 2025, the world record for the heaviest luffa was broken at the NC State Fair. The luffa, grown in Graham, NC weighed 11 lb 3.3 oz (5.08 kg).The name luffa was taken by European botanists in the 17th century from the Arabic name لوف lūf.

The fruit section of L. aegyptiaca may be allowed to mature and used as a bath or kitchen sponge after being processed to remove everything except the network of xylem fibers. If the loofah is allowed to fully ripen and then dried on the vine, the flesh disappears, leaving only the fibrous skeleton and seeds, which can be easily shaken out.

It is also a traditional pulse cultivated across the Mediterranean region and elsewhere.The white lupin is an annual, more or less pubescent plant that typically reaches 30 to 120 cm in height. It grows naturally throughout the Balkans, the island of Sicily, and Turkey, and is also widely naturalised across the Mediterranean region including North Africa, in Europe north to Great Britain, Germany, the Baltic States and western Russia, and also in the Indian subcontinent. Naturalised populations are also known in Australia and Chile. It is found in meadows, pastures, and grassy slopes on both sandy and acidic soil. The white lupin is cultivated throughout the Mediterranean region and in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Syria, Europe, South America, and tropical and southern Africa. The ancient cultivation of white lupin under the local name hanchcoly was practiced until recently in western Georgia. It is also sometimes known in cultivation as \"field lupin\", though this name is imprecise, having been applied to several species in the genus. White lupin is distinct within the large and polymorphous genus Lupinus for a small variation of morphological characteristics. However, the species has wide, intraspecific variability in physiological plant properties; the duration of vernalisation time and growth rate, photoperiodic sensitivity,"

It is native to Eurasia and northern Africa and naturalized in parts of Australia and North America. It has been cultivated for over 6000 years as a food crop for its edible legume seeds, as a fodder for livestock and for green manure.Like other legumes, the narrow-leaved lupin fixes nitrogen in a symbiotic interaction with different bacteria in the rhizosphere. Bacteria living in this rhizosphere include Bradyrhizobium lupinii or the newly discovered species Kribbella lupini. In some places these bacteria are not native to the soil and need to be inocculated onto the seed for the lupins to have a nitrogen fixing effect. It was found that Lupins accumulate on average 195.4 kg N/h, 80 % of which were fixed from the atmosphere. The narrow-leaved lupin is an erect, branching herb sometimes exceeding one meter. There are reduced-branching cultivars. Each palmate leaf is divided into 5 to 9 linear leaflets under 4 centimeters long. The herbage is slightly hairy in some areas. The inflorescence bears many flowers in shades of blue, violet, pink, or white. The fruit is a legume pod containing seeds of varying colors from dark gray to brown to white, or speckled or mottled. Lupinus angustifolius has a high content of alkaloids, e.g. lupanin or angustifolin. However, cultivars with a low alkaloid content have been bred. These low alkaloid cultivars ar"

The fern is present in the southeastern United States, Puerto Rico, South Africa, and Australia as an introduced species.This fern produces a creeping stem from which grow very long leaves, the longest exceeding 30 metres (98 feet). The leaves have rachises, which are vine-like and may climb other vegetation. What appear to be individual leaves sprouting from the twining rachis are actually leaflets, which are smaller segments from the main leaf. There are two types of leaflets, sterile and fertile. The sterile frond has lance-shaped segments. The fertile frond has more intricately divided, fringed segments. It is lined with sporangia on the edges. The plant reproduces via spores and spreads vegetatively via underground rhizomes. The specific epithet japonicum, refers to the Latin term for 'being from Japan'. It was first published and described as Ophioglossum japonicum in the family Ophioglossaceae by Carl Peter Thunberg in Syst.

Male flowers are minute, numerous, and clustered in the axils of large bracts. One round, black seed is in a spherical capsule 4 to 5 mm across. Mallotus tetracoccus is a pioneer or early-successional or early-secondary tree species more common in forest edges, clearings, and secondary forests than in mature forest interiors. Ecophysiological studies indicate that Macaranga peltata shows a combination of high quantum use efficiency of photosynthetic system (Fv/Fm) and relative growth rates under higher light conditions, similar in pattern to other pioneer species such as Mallotus tetracoccus.

It is a large tree of family Sapotaceae, flowers during cold season and fruit ripens in June–July. It commonly occurs in the sub Himalayan tract between 300-1500m from sea level.Fat is extracted from the seeds and named chiuri ghee or phulwara butter. D. butyracea is useful for block planting and also to be grown in the ravines of hills. The latex yielding plant such as D. butyracea suits to different edapho-climatic conditions and thus does not compete with the traditional crops. The chiuri tree has been utilised for many uses by rural households in Nepal. Ghee is used in daily cooking, as fuel for lamps, and body lotion; the fruit is eaten fresh and use for alcohol distillation, oil-cakes are utilised as manure, and the tree itself is used as firewood. Additionally, it also has significant cultural and livelihood associations with the Chepang community (Nepali:चेपांग) of Nepal and are given as dowry to daughters. Because of its cultural significance, it has been recognised as a cultural keystone species of central Nepal's Chepang people.

It may have spread to the British Isles during the Middle Ages. Marjoram was not widely used in the United States until after World War II. The name marjoram (Old French: majorane; Medieval Latin: majorana) does not directly derive from the Latin word maior (major). Marjoram is related to Samhain, the Celtic pagan holiday that would eventually become Halloween. It has also been used in Sephardi Jewish tradition as a ritual medical practice. Ancient Greeks believed the plant was created by Aphrodite. In one myth, the royal perfumer of Cyprus, Amaracus, was transformed into marjoram. To the Romans the herb was known as the herb of happiness, and was believed to increase lifespan.

Fruit trees of the orchard or domestic apple (Malus domestica), the most widely grown in the genus, are cultivated worldwide. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia before they were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have cultural significance in many mythologies (including Norse and Greek) and religions (such as Christianity in Europe). Apples grown from seeds tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.The word apple is derived from Old Engl"

Malva is a genus that consists of about 30 species of plants. This genus consists of plants named mallows. Mallows grow in many regions, including temperate, subtropical, and tropical areas.Malva pusilla is native to temperate and Mediterranean Europe, Turkey, Caucasia, and northwest Iran. It is invasive to North America, Europe, and Korea. In the United States, in can specifically be found in the states of California, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Malva pusilla can be found widely in wastelands, grasslands, pastures, and by roadsides. It is easy to grow in ordinary garden conditions in moist, fertile soil and a sunny setting. It is prone to predation by rabbits and infestation by rust fungus. Mallows can be used as garden flowers. However, some species may be considered weeds, especially in areas where they are not native. Malva pusilla grows rapidly as a weed in gardens and farmlands. It is considered hard to get rid of because of its long and tough taproots. Among cultivated crops, it can be very competitive and it can spread very quickl"

In a broader circumscription, all the plants native to the regions around the Mediterranean Sea are placed in M. officinarum, which thus includes M. autumnalis. The names autumn mandrake and Mediterranean mandrake are then used. Whatever the circumscription, Mandragora officinarum is a perennial herbaceous plant with ovate leaves arranged in a rosette, a thick upright root, often branched, and bell-shaped flowers followed by yellow or orange berries. Because mandrakes contain deliriant hallucinogenic tropane alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine) which cause delirium and hallucinations, and the shape of their roots often resembles human figures, they have been associated with a variety of religious and spiritual practices throughout history. They have long been used in magic rituals, today also in contemporary Pagan practices such as Wicca and Heathenry.

Approximately 500–1000 varieties have been identified, named, or reported, primarily in India. It can grow up to 15–30 metres (50–100 feet) tall with a similar crown width and a trunk circumference of more than 3.7 m (12 ft). The leaves are simple, shiny and dark green. The trees take 2–4 years from planting time to first harvest, and can have a productive life of over 50 years. Yellow-white fragrant flowers appear at the end of winter through the beginning of spring, varying with location. Both male and female flowers are borne on the same tree. Climatic conditions have a significant influence on the time of flowering. In India, flowering starts in December in the south, in January in Bengal, in February in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and in February–March in northern India. The duration of flowering is 20–25 days for the Dasheri variety, while panicle emergence occurs in early December and flower opening is completed by February. The Neelum variety produces two crops a year in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, but it flowers only once in North Indian conditions. "

Cassava is predominantly consumed in boiled form, but substantial quantities are processed to extract cassava starch, called tapioca, which is used for food, animal feed, and industrial purposes. The Brazilian farofa, and the related garri of West Africa, is an edible coarse flour obtained by grating cassava roots, pressing moisture off the obtained grated pulp, and finally drying and roasting it. Cassava is the third-largest source of carbohydrates in food in the tropics, after rice and maize, making it an important staple; more than 500 million people depend on it. It offers the advantage of being exceptionally drought-tolerant, and able to grow productively on poor soil. The largest producer is Nigeria, while Thailand is the largest exporter of cassava starch. Cassava is grown in sweet and bitter varieties; both contain toxins, but the bitter varieties have them in much larger amounts. Cassava has to be prepared carefully for consumption, as improperly prepared material can contain sufficient cyanide to cause poisoning.

The upper side of the wing is dark brown to black and patterned with bluish-white, semi-transparent spots and lines. The blue of the bluish-white spots consists of the pigment pterobilin. In general, all butterflies can directly absorb heat from the sun via their wings to facilitate autonomous flight. Studies on blue tiger butterflies show that high-intensity light significantly increased flight activity. Blue tiger butterflies have a wing surface color that is composed of both light and dark colors. The dark areas on the wing surfaces are the heat absorption areas that allow for the facilitation of autonomous flight.

Commonly, the name M. recutita is applied to the herbal product chamomile, although other species are also used as chamomile. The plant is commonly used to make a tea. M. chamomilla, historically used in various ancient cultures and commonly promoted today for a range of conditions, shows limited reliable evidence for effectiveness, may have mild side effects or drug interactions, and should be used with caution—especially around allergies, estrogen-sensitive conditions, and during pregnancy.Matricaria chamomilla is a member of the Asteraceae family, native to southern and eastern Europe. It can be found on all continents, has a branched, erect and smooth stem, and grows to a height of 15–60 cm (6–24 in). The long and narrow leaves are bipinnate or tripinnate. The flowers are borne in paniculate flower heads (capitula). The white ray florets are furnished with a ligule, while the disc florets are yellow. The hollow receptacle is swollen and lacks scales. This property distinguishes German chamomile from Anthemis arvensis (corn chamomile), which has a receptacle with scales. The flowers bloom in early to midsummer and are fragrant.

Spread across an area of 264,091 km2 (101,966 sq mi), it is one of the largest subtropical deserts in Asia by area. About two-thirds of the desert area lies in India, with the remaining in Pakistan. It forms about six percent of the geographical area of India, with majority of the desert lying in the state of Rajasthan, with portions extending into Gujarat, Haryana, and Punjab. Towards the west, it extends into the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan. It is bordered by the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the north, west and northeast, Rann of Kutch to the south, and the Aravali Range to the east. During the Last Glacial Maximum, an ice sheet covered the Tibetan Plateau, which reflected more solar radiation into space, resulting in cooling the overlying atmosphere during that period. Without the thermal low pressure caused by the heating, there was no monsoon over the Indian subcontinent, which led to the deposition of dust and the desertification of the region. The upliftment of the Aravallis brought about changes in the hydrography of the region, and the Ghaggar-Hakra River system that fed the region dried up, and the region became increasingly arid. Over the years, wind blown sediments and sand from the alluvial plains and the coast accumulated in the region. The topography consists "

It has also been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiraled in two to three turns containing 10–20 seeds. It is native to warmer temperate climates.Alfalfa has an autotetraploid genome with tetrasomic inheritance. It is a perennial forage legume which normally lives four to eight years but can live more than 20 years, depending on variety and climate. The plant grows to a height of up to 1 metre (3+1⁄2 feet). Its root system typically grows to a depth of 2–3 m (7–10 ft) depending on subsoil constraints but sometimes grows to a depth of more than 15 m (49 ft) to reach groundwater. Alfalfa is a small-seeded crop and has a slowly growing seedling, but after several months of establishment, it forms a tough \"crown\" at the top of the root system. This crown contains shoot buds that enable alfalfa to regrow many times after being grazed or harvested.

In 2001 Karsten Meyer proposed a revision in which the species Melastoma affine and other species were subsumed within this species M. malabathricum.

It may have been eaten by indigenous peoples before the European colonization of the Americas began.Melothria scabra is a vine similar in morphology to Melothria pendula. It has a climbing habit, and typically grows 2.5–3 m (8.2–9.8 ft) tall. It is fast growing: germination under favourable conditions takes approximately 10 days, with plants reaching maturity in approximately 60–75 days. It is a perennial species, but as it is not frost hardy it is often grown as an annual. Its leaves have three or five lobes, and are 3–7 cm (1.2–2.8 in) in length and width. The leaf margin is undulate or dentate, the apex is caudate, and the leaf base is cordate. The leaf surface is scabrous; the upper surface is covered with small hairs called trichomes. Similar to some types of cucumber, these plants are monoecious, producing both male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers on the same plant. Flowers are small and yellow, and are approximately 4 mm (0.2 in) in diameter. Unusually for the cucurbits, the female flowers appear before the male flowers.

The stems are square in cross section, green or purple, and variably hairy to almost hairless. The rhizomes are wide-spreading, fleshy, and bear fibrous roots. The leaves are ovate to ovate-lanceolate, 2 to 6 centimetres (0.79 to 2.36 in) long and 1 to 4 centimetres (0.39 to 1.57 in) broad, green (sometimes purplish), opposite, toothed, and vary from hairy to nearly hairless. The flowers of the watermint are tiny, densely crowded, purple, tubular, pinkish to lilac in colour and form a terminal hemispherical inflorescence; flowering is from mid to late summer. Water mint is visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome, but can also spread by underground rhizomes. All parts of the plant have a distinctly minty smell. Unbranched, hairless plants, with narrower leaves and paler flowers, native to areas of Sweden and Finland near the Baltic Sea, have been called Mentha aquatica var. litoralis. Mentha aquatica is a polyploid, with 2n = 8x = 96 chromosomes. Mentha aquatica was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.

Although the genus Mentha comprises more than 25 species, the one in most common use is peppermint.

M. × piperita and M. haplocalyx are both recognised as plant sources of menthol and menthone, and are among the oldest herbs used for both culinary and medicinal products.Peppermint was first identified in Hertfordshire, England, by a Dr. Eales, a discovery which John Ray published 1696 in the second edition of his book Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicarum. He initially gave it the name Mentha spicis brevioribus et habitioribus, foliis Mentha fusca, sapore fervido piperis and later in his 1704 volume Historia Plantarum he called it Mentha palustris or Peper–Mint. The plant was then added to the London Pharmacopoeia under the name Mentha piperitis sapore in 1721. It was given the name Mentha piperita in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum Volume 2.

The leaves are 5–9 cm (2–3+1⁄2 in) long and 1.5–3 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄4 in) broad, with a serrated margin. The stem is square-shaped, a defining characteristic of the mint family of herbs. Spearmint produces flowers in slender spikes, each flower pink or white in colour, 2.5–3 mm (0.098–0.118 in) long and broad. Spearmint flowers in the summer (from July to September in the northern hemisphere), and has relatively large seeds, which measure 0.62–0.90 mm (0.024–0.035 in). The name ''spear'' mint derives from the pointed leaf tips. Mentha spicata varies considerably in leaf blade dimensions, the prominence of leaf veins, and pubescence. Mentha spicata was first described scientifically by Carl Li"

It is estimated that 13 to 24 species exist, but the exact distinction between species is unclear. Hybridization occurs naturally where some species' ranges overlap. Many hybrids and cultivars are known. The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution, growing best in wet environments and moist soils.Mints are aromatic, almost exclusively perennial herbs. They have wide-spreading underground and overground stolons and erect, square, branched stems. Mints will grow 10–120 cm (4–47 in) tall and can spread over an indeterminate area. Due to their tendency to spread unchecked, some mints are considered invasive. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, from oblong to lanceolate, often downy, and with a serrated margin. Leaf colours range from dark green and gray-green to purple, blue, and sometimes pale yellow. The flowers are produced in long bracts from leaf axils. They are white to purple and produced in false whorls called verticillasters. The corolla is two-lipped with four subequal lobes, the upper lobe usually the largest. The fruit is a nutlet, containing one to four seeds. Mentha is a member of the tribe Mentheae in the subfamily Nepetoideae.

The North American form is often referred to as M. trifoliata var. minor Michx. It is known in English by the common names bogbean, marsh trefoil and buckbean.Menyanthes trifoliata has a horizontal rhizome with alternate, trifoliate leaves. The inflorescence is an erect raceme of white flowers. The buds are rose-pink in color. The flowers when fully open look like \"white stars\" and the petals are fringed with white whiskers. The species occurs in fens and bogs in Asia, Europe, and North America. In eastern North America, it is considered to be a diagnostic fen species. It sometimes creates big quagmires with its thick roots. The name Menyanthes comes from Greek menyein 'disclosing' and anthos 'flower' in reference to the sequential opening of flowers on the inflorescence. One fossil seed of Menyanthes trifoliata has been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland. The species is protected in the United States. It is a host plant to the endangered bog buck moth, Hemileuca maia menyanthevora. The rootstock can be ground into an unpalatable flour for emergency use. The plant has a characteristic strong and bitter taste, which can be used in schnapps.

One of several genera commonly referred to as sage, it includes two widely used herbs, Salvia officinalis (common sage, or just \"sage\") and Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary, formerly Rosmarinus officinalis). The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas (over 900 total species), with three distinct regions of diversity: Central America and South America (approximately 600 species); Central Asia and the Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species).The name Salvia derives from Latin salvia (sage), from salvus (safe, secure, healthy), an adjective related to salūs (health, well-being, prosperity or salvation), and salvēre (to feel healthy, to heal). Pliny the Elder was the first author known to describe a plant called \"Salvia\" by the Romans, likely describing the type species for the genus Salvia, Salvia officinalis. The common modern English name sage derives from Middle English sawge, which was borrowed from Old French sauge, from Latin salvia (the source of the botanical name). When used without modifiers, the name \"sage\" generally refers to Salvia officinalis (\"common sage\" or \"culinary sage\"), although it is used with modifiers to refer to any member of the genus.

The species has been declared critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, with the main threats being: hunting, habitat loss and pet trade. They are one of three species in the genus Pygathrix, the other two being the black-shanked (P. nigripes) and gray-shanked (P. cinerea) doucs. Red-shanked doucs live in fission-fusion, multilevel societies that have a mean of 18 individuals per band. They are folivorous and consume mainly Acacia pruinescens, Ficus racemosa, Millettia nigrescens, Zanthoxylum avicennae and Castanopsis ceratacantha. Their four-chambered stomachs that allow for bacterial fermentation help them with their high-fiber diet.The red-shanked douc is native to Indochina; Vietnam, southern Laos, and possibly northeastern Cambodia, east of the Mekong river. Before 1967, the douc was completely unstudied. It is the only douc species that inhabits all three countries of Indochina.

In the name Millingtonia hortensis, Millingtonia is named for Sir Thomas Millington who was an inspiration to Carl Linnaeus the Younger who first described the genus. The specific epithet 'hortensia' derives from 'hortensis' and 'hortus' which in Latin is related to the garden. In its synonym, Bignonia suberosa, 'suberosa' derives from 'suberos' which means 'corky' in Latin. Millingtonia Avenue in Lucknow is named after Millingtonia hortensis.Genetic analysis suggests the closest relative of Millingtonia is the genus Oroxylum; this pair of genera are then probably next most closely related to a clade containing Catalpa and Chilopsis. The tree grows to a height of between 18 and 25 metres and has a spread of 7 to 11 metres. It reaches maturity between 6 and 8 years of age and lives for up to 40 years. It is a versatile tree which can grow in various soil types and climates with a preference for moist climates.Like Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, it blooms during the night and sheds during the morning. Its flowers emit a pleasant smell. The tree is evergreen and has an elongated pyramidal stem. The soft, yellowish-white wood is brittle and can break under strong gusts of wind.

It is often grown for its curiosity value: the sensitive compound leaves quickly fold inward and droop when touched or shaken and re-open a few minutes later. For this reason, this species is commonly cited as an example of rapid plant movement. Like a number of other plant species, it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed \"sleep\" or nyctinastic movement. The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light. This was first studied by French scientist Jean-Jacques d'Ortous. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The species is native to the Caribbean and South and Central America, but is now a pantropical weed, and can now be found in the Southern United States, South Asia, East Asia, Micronesia, Australia, South Africa, and West Africa as well. It is not shade-tolerant and is primarily found on soils with low nutrient concentrations.Mimosa pudica was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum in 1753. The species epithet, pudica, is Latin for 'shame', 'bashful', or 'shrinking', alluding to its shrinking reaction to contact. The species is known by numerous common names including sensitive plant, action plant, humble plant, shameplant, and touch-me-not. The stem is erect"

The genus now contains only seven species, two native to eastern North America and the other five native to Asia, Australia, Africa, or Madagascar. In the past, about 150 species were placed in this genus, most of which have since been assigned to other genera, the majority to genus Erythranthe. Mimulus species prefer wet or moist areas and are not drought resistant. Several are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. The cultivar 'Highland Red' has received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.Mimulus is based on the Latin word mimus ('mimic', especially in the context of acting). This may have to do with the flowers seeming to have grinning faces resembling those of monkeys. The color patterns of Mimulus flowers are determined by an inverted repeat in the YELLOW UPPER (YUP) genetic locus. YUP causes production of phase-patterned siRNAs that regulate color carotenoids. YUP itself evolved from a fragment of a cytochrome protein unrelated to flower coloration. Before the 2012 restructuring, two large groups of species had long been recognized in the genus Mimulus as it was traditionally defined, with the largest group of species in western North America, and a second group with center of diversity in Australia.

The leaves are 10–20 centimetres (4–8 inches) long by 6–10 cm (2–4 in) broad – up to 23 cm (9 in) long on vigorous shoots, downy on the underside, the upper surface rough with very short, stiff hairs. Each somatic cell has 308 chromosomes in total, and exhibits tetratetracontaploidy (44x), meaning that its genome contains seven chromosomes, and each somatic cell has 44 copies of each.

Many parts of the plant—in particular the new growth, flowers and fruit—are covered in fine irritant hairs.Mucuna gigantea is a large woody twining climber with a stem diameter of up to 10 cm (3.9 in). It usually grows to about 30 m (98 ft) in length, although it may reach up to 80 m (260 ft). New growth is covered in orange-brown hairs, while mature parts of the stem are glabrous with dark, raised lenticels, and the stem may be irregularly shaped. The trifoliate leaves are arranged alternately on the stems, attached to the twigs by petioles up to 15 cm (5.9 in) long, and the petiole base is swollen into a pulvinus. The central leaflet is elliptic to ovate while the two lateral leaflets are oblique (asymmetric), and they measure up to 15 cm (5.9 in) long by 8 cm (3.1 in) wide. All leaflets have rounded bases and acuminate to apiculate tips, with 4–6 pairs of lateral veins either side of the midrib. The inflorescence is produced in the leaf axils, and is a pendulous, umbel-like cluster on a long branched peduncle measuring between 8 and 25 cm (3.1 and 9.8 in) long. The individual flowers are held on short lateral stalks. Each flower has a cup-shaped calyx with two lips, clad in fine greyish hairs. The c"

The plant has three layers; a brown pod covered in small hairs, curved petals usually colored purple and black round-shaped beans. Small hairs on the pod can irritate the skin.The petals of the Muncuna monnosperma flower opens at night and closes in the morning. It is found in India, including the eastern Himalayas, the northeastern states, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand. Its natural habitat is evergreen forests, and it commonly grows near swamps or along streams. It is discovered that M. monosperma contains L-DOPA, which is a chemical compound commonly used against Parkinson's disease. The beans of the plant contains 5.48% L-DOPA, and the content increases 6.58% when beans are soaked in water. Another research showed that M. monosperma can accelerate melanin production that can be beneficial in cosmetics, agriculture and medicine. Other than its possible medical uses, M. monosperma has already been consumed as food in areas where it is endemic to. According to Dr. Sturtevants, it is a well-loved fruit among Brahmins.

Its English common names include monkey tamarind, velvet bean, Bengal velvet bean, Florida velvet bean, Mauritius velvet bean, Yokohama velvet bean, cowage, cowitch, lacuna bean, and Lyon bean. The plant is notorious for the extreme itchiness it produces on contact, particularly with the young foliage and the seed pods. It also produces many medium-sized red swollen bumps on the skin with the itching. It has agricultural and horticultural value, and is used in herbalism.Mucuna pruriens is an annual climbing shrub with long vines that can reach over 15 metres (50 feet) in length. When the plant is young, it is almost completely covered with fuzzy hairs, but when older, it is almost completely free of hairs. The leaves are tripinnate, ovate, reverse ovate, rhombus-shaped or widely ovate. The sides of the leaves are often heavily grooved and the tips are pointy. In young specimens, both sides of the leaves have hairs. The stems of the leaflets are 2–3 millimetres (1⁄16–1⁄8 inch) long. Additional adjacent leaves are present and are about 5 mm (1⁄4 in) long. The flower heads take the form of axially arrayed panicles. They are 15–32 centimetres (6–13 in) long and have two or three, or many flowers, which can be white, lavender, or purple.

    "knowledge_text": "Musa × paradisiaca is a species as well as a cultivar, originating as the hybrid between Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, cultivated and domesticated by humans very early. Most cultivated bananas and plantains are polyploid cultivars either of this hybrid or of M. acuminata alone. Linnaeus originally used the name M. paradisiaca only for plantains or cooking bananas, but the modern usage includes hybrid cultivars used both for cooking and as dessert bananas. Linnaeus's name for dessert bananas, Musa sapientum, is thus a synonym of Musa × paradisiaca.Almost all cultivated plantains and many cultivated bananas are cultivars of the hybrid between two wild species, M. acuminata and M. balbisiana. It is believed that Southeast Asian farmers first domesticated M. acuminata. When the cultivated plants spread north-west into areas where M.balbisiana was native (see map), hybrids between the two species occurred and were then developed further into a wide range of cultivars. Hundreds of cultivars of two species are known, possessing characteristics that are highly variable, but broadly intermediate between the ancestral species. They are typically 2–9 metres (7–30 ft) tall when mature. The above-ground part of the plant is a \"false stem\" or pseudostem, consisting of leaves and their fused bases. Each pseudostem can produce a single flowering stem. After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots may develop from the base of the plant. Cultivars of banana are usually sterile, with"

It is indigenous to Southern and Eastern Africa, the Azores, the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia and East Asia.The shrub can achieve heights of over 2 metres (6.6 ft) and may be dense if pruned or grown in strong sunlight. The fine-toothed leaves are at first deep red, but on maturity become glossy and dark green. The cream-coloured flowers appear in spring, with the male flowers boasting red anthers. Separate shrubs produce either male or female flowers, with the female plants also producing small purple berries. The foliage is dense, and dark-green to red in color. The hardy plant is long-lived. M. africana sends up occasional shoots from its root system that go on to form new plants. It propagates easily from seed. Parts of the plant are used in milk and meat-based soups by the Batemi and Masai people of Africa, which is thought to reduce cholesterol levels in tribes that consume large amounts of meat. The flowers are also eaten. A powder derived from the plant's leaves is called katam (كتم), used to dye hair since ancient times. Cape myrtle is increasingly popular for topiaries and small hedges, as it can so readily be pruned and shaped.  http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantklm/myrsinafr.htm Media related to Myrsine africana at Wikimedia Commons"

The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, growing to 5 metres (16 ft) tall. The leaves are 2–5 centimetres (1–2 in) long, with a fragrant essential oil. The flowers are white or tinged with pink, with five petals and many stamens that protrude from the flower. The fruit is an edible berry, blue-black when ripe. The essential oils derived from this plant have anti-proliferative and anti-quorum sensing properties, helping against food spoilage. The berries are also macerated in alcohol to make Mirto liqueur. This species and the more compact M. communis subsp. tarentina have won the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. They are hardy but prefer a sheltered position in full sun. The plant can be propagated with seeds stratified for 3 months. Also, one can use a cutting with a short heel (small part of the bark), keeping it in moistened rooting mix. == References =="

It is a source of a type of intensely aromatic amber-colored essential oil, spikenard. The oil has, since ancient times, been used as a perfume, as a traditional medicine, and in religious ceremonies. It is also called spikenard, nard, nardin, or muskroot. It is considered endangered due to overharvesting for folk medicine, overgrazing, loss of habitats, and forest degradation.The plant grows 10–50 cm (4–20 in) in height and has pink, bell-shaped flowers. Rhizomes (underground stems) can be crushed and distilled into an intensely aromatic amber-colored essential oil, which is very thick in consistency. Nard oil is used as a perfume, an incense, a sedative, and a herbal medicine said to fight insomnia, birth difficulties, and other minor ailments. Inhalations with added oil help relieve symptoms of colds, coughs and nasal congestion.

Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond. While some sprout immediately and most are eaten by wildlife, the remaining seeds can remain dormant for an extensive period of time as the pond silts in and dries out. During flood conditions, sediments containing these seeds are broken open, and the dormant seeds rehydrate and begin a new lotus colony. It is cultivated in nutrient-rich, loamy, and often flooded soils, requiring warm temperatures and specific planting depths, with propagation via rhizomes, seeds, or tissue culture, and is harvested by hand or machine for stolons, flowers, seeds, and rhizomes over several months depending on climate and variety. It is the national flower of India and unofficially of Vietnam. It has large leaves and flowers that can regulate their temperature, produces long-living seeds, and contains bioactive alkaloids.

Originating in Asia Minor, it is abundant throughout the Mediterranean Basin, with wild subspecies in Africa and western Asia; modern cultivars are traced primarily to the Near East, Aegean Sea, and Strait of Gibraltar. The olive is the type species for its genus, Olea, and lends its name to the Oleaceae plant family, which includes lilac, jasmine, forsythia, and ash. The olive fruit is classed botanically as a drupe, similar in structure and function to the cherry or peach. The term oil—now used to describe any viscous water-insoluble liquid—was originally synonymous with olive oil, the liquid fat derived from olives. The olive has deep historical, economic, and cultural significance in the Mediterranean. It is among the oldest fruit trees domesticated by humans, being first cultivated in the Eastern Mediterranean between 6,000 and 4,000 BC, most likely in the Levant. The olive gradually disseminated throughout the Mediterranean via trade and human migration starting in the 16th century BC; it took root in Crete around 3500 BC and reached Iberia by about 1050 BC. Olive cultivation was vital to the growth and prosperity of various Mediterranean civilizations, from the Minoans and Myceneans of the Bronze Age to the Greeks and Romans of classical antiquity. The olive has long been prized throughout the Mediterranean for its myriad uses and properties. As"

Leaf fronds are ovate in shape and possess smooth toothless lobes. The spike has around 10-40 segments on each side. It is native to many regions with a wide scattered distribution: throughout temperate through tropical Africa and throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere in Europe, northeastern North America, temperate Asia, and Eurasia. This small, hard-to-spot plant can occur singly in unimproved pastures, rock crevices and grassy path-sides, but also can occur in colonies of hundreds of plants in sand dunes. In Finland, unlike elsewhere, it grows on seashores, unlike other parts of the world where it tends to be a calciphile. Finland has fitting lime rich soil habitat sparsely, but the plant has found an equivalent living habitat from Finland's seashores affected by a post-glacial rebound: land just risen from the sea is often quite neutral and contains mineral salts in addition to being open and bare enough. Ophioglossum vulgatum can reproduce vegetatively through new buds that sprout from the"

Cacti are native to the Americas, and are well adapted to arid climates; however, they are still vulnerable to alterations in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change. The plant has been introduced to Australia, southern Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. Prickly pear alone is also used to refer to the fruit, but may also be used for the plant itself; in addition, other names given to the plant and its specific parts include tuna (fruit), sabra, sabbar, nopal (pads, plural nopales, from the Nahuatl word nōpalli), nostle (fruit) from the Nahuatl word nōchtli, and paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus. The fruit and leaves are edible. The most common culinary species is the \"Barbary fig\" (Opuntia ficus-indica). In places where they have been introduced outside their native range, some species in the genus Opuntia behave as aggressive invasive species.O. ficus-indica is a large, trunk-forming, segmented cactus that may grow to 5–7 metres (16–23 feet) with a crown of over 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and a trunk diameter of 1 m (1 yard).

It was native to the Mediterranean region, but widely naturalised elsewhere in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Oregano is a woody perennial plant, growing to 90 cm (35 in) tall, with opposite leaves 1–4 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) long. The flowers which can be white, pink or light purple, are 3–4 mm (1⁄8–3⁄16 in) long, and produced in erect spikes in summer. It is sometimes called wild marjoram, while its close relative O. majorana is known as sweet marjoram. Both are widely used as culinary herbs, especially in Turkish, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Latin, and French cuisine. Oregano is also an ornamental plant, with numerous cultivars bred for varying leaf colour, flower colour and habit.The English word \"oregano\" is a borrowing of the Spanish orégano, which derives from the Latin orīganum, which itself comes from Classical Greek ὀρίγανον (orī́ganon). The ultimate origin is disputed; some claim it is a compound Greek term that consists of ὄρος (óros) meaning \"mountain\", and γάνος (gános) meaning \"joy\", thus, \"joy of the mountain\" while The Oxford English Dictionary states it is \"probably a loanword [as] the plant comes from Africa\". Oregano is a perennial, although it is grown as an annual in colder climates, as it often does not survive the winter. It grows to 90 centimetres (35 in) tall and 50 cm (20 in) wide. The leaves are spade-shaped and olive-green. The flowers are purple, pink"

This parasite is most common in the Middle East and has a wide host range including many economically important crops. Selective control of Egyptian broomrape is extremely difficult because the close association between host crop and parasite limits the use of most mechanical and herbicidal approaches.A single Egyptian broomrape plant is capable of producing hundreds of thousands of extremely small (0.15–0.5 millimetres (1⁄128–5⁄256 in) long) seeds. These seeds, dispersed by the wind, animals, or by more artificial means such as farm machinery, survive in the soil and have the ability to remain viable in the soil for more than 15 years. When the seeds are dropped, they are dormant. They require after-ripening, or further ripening after the seed has fallen from the plant, which is completed by the time the dry season has ended. As the rainy season begins, the seeds imbibe water and move into a conditioning phase which lasts 1–3 weeks, depending on whether the temperature remains optimal, between 60 and 70 °F (16 and 21 °C). At this point, the seeds only need a chemical signal from the roots of a host plant to germinate. The seeds can remain in this conditioned state for several months. If the seed never receives the chemical signal to germinate and dries out, it returns to its dormant state, ready to be reconditioned when the next r"

The species is sometimes known as flowering fern due to the appearance of its fertile fronds.Royal fern is a large perennial herb with stout ascending rhizomes that over many years build up a woody, trunk-like base covered by interwoven roots, 1 m or more high. The fronds, or leaves, arise directly from this rhizome and are very large, typically up to 120 cm but exceptionally as much as 400 cm long and 30-40 cm broad. Each frond is bipinnate, with 5–9 pairs of pinnae up to 30 cm (12 in) long, each pinna with 7–13 pairs of pinnules 2.5–6.5 cm (0.98–2.56 in) long and 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) broad. Many of the fronds have a terminal fertile portion, where the blade is reduced almost to the midrib and densely covered with brown sporangia. The fronds are at first covered with golden-brown hairs which quickly disappear, leaving a smooth, pale green surface to the leaves. Veins are prominent on both surfaces. In the gametophyte stage, the prothallus is a small, green, fleshy plant just a few millimetres in size. The native range of royal fern is throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East as far as Iran, from Norway south to Algeria.

It resembles the common yellow woodsorrel, Oxalis stricta.It has a narrow, creeping stem that easily takes root at the nodes. Its trifoliate leaves are subdivided into three rounded leaflets, resembling a clover. Some varieties have green leaves, while others, such as Oxalis corniculata var. atropurpurea, have purple leaves. There are inconspicuous stipules at the base of each petiole. The small, yellow flowers have either round-edged or sharp-ended petals. The flowers close when the plant is not within direct sunlight, hence the name \"sleeping beauty\". Some specimens can have a single flower while others can have over 20. The fruit is a narrow, cylindrical capsule, 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) long, and noteworthy for its explosive discharge of the contained seeds, 1 mm (0.04 in) long. Pollen is about 34 microns in diameter.

It grows in dense tufts, with stems that are usually unbranched and hairless. Both flowering stems and leaf stalks are somewhat reddish. The leaves are kidney-shaped, somewhat fleshy, on stalks from the basal part of the stem. Flowers are small, green and later reddish, and are grouped in an open upright cluster. The fruit is a small nut, encircled by a broad wing which finally turns red. Forming dense, red tufts, the plant is easily recognized. Oxyria digyna grows in wet places protected by snow in winter. Oxyria (from Greek) means \"sour\". Mountain sorrel is common in the tundra of the Arctic. Further south, it has a circumboreal distribution, growing in high mountainous areas in the Northern Hemisphere such as the Alps, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. It typically grows in alpine meadows, scree, snow-bed sites and beside streams. On the coast of Norway, the pollen of this plant has been found in peat bogs that are 12,600 years old, indicating that it must have been one of the first plants to colonise the area after the retreating ice age glaciers.

Typical habitat is seasonally-dry tropical forest and thicket, often at forest margins, in scrub vegetation, and in open grassy areas. Plants in the genus grow from large, often edible taproots.The jícama or yam bean (P. erosus) is a vine widely grown for its large (10–15 cm diameter and up to 20 kg weight), spherical or elongated taproot. After removal of the thick, fibrous brown skin, the white flesh of the root can be eaten cooked or raw. Crisp, moist, and slightly sweet, the flesh draws comparison with that of the apple. The plant produces seeds that are comparable to lima beans, and that are sometimes eaten when young in places where the jicama is native. The mature seeds contain high levels of rotenone, a chemical used as an insecticide and pesticide. The remainder of the jícama plant is very poisonous. Jícama comes from the New World; the name jícama is used in Central / South America. Today, pachyrhizus erosus is grown throughout Asia.

It has been introduced in the tropics around the world. It has previously been called Urochloa maxima and Panicum maximum. It was moved to the genus Megathyrsus in 2003.Megathyrsus maximus grows naturally in open grasslands, usually under or near trees and shrubs and along riverbanks. It can withstand wildfire and drought. The species has broad morphological and agronomic variability, ranging in height from 0.5 to 3.5 m (1.6 to 11.5 ft), with 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) stems. The polyploid plant also can reproduce through apomixis, effectively cloning itself through seed. Panicles are open, with as many as 9,000 seeds per plant. It can be used as a long-term foraging grass if grazed consistently and if fertilized. It is well suited for cut-and-carry, a practice in which grass is harvested and brought to a ruminant animal in an enclosed system. Shade tolerance makes it suited to coexisting with trees in agroforestry. Some varieties have been used successfully for making silage and hay. The leaves contain good levels of protein (6–25% depending on age and nitrogen supply). In some places, such as South Texas, Sri Lanka and Hawai'i, it is an invasive weed that suppresses or displaces local native plants and is a fire hazard.

It is native to Europe, North Africa and south-western Asia and widespread as an introduction in America and elsewhere.Papaver dubium is a variable annual, growing to about 60 cm in height. It generally flowers in late spring to mid-summer. The flower is large (30–70 mm) and showy, with four petals that are lighter red than in the similar Papaver rhoeas, and most commonly without a black spot at the base. The flower stem is usually covered with coarse hairs that are closely appressed to the surface, helping to distinguish it from P. rhoeas in which the hairs are more usually patent, held at right angles to the stem. The capsules are hairless, elongated to more than twice as tall as they are wide, tapering slightly at the tip, with a stigma generally less wide than the capsule. The plant exudes white to yellowish latex when the tissues are broken. The species can form a long-lived soil seed bank that can germinate when the soil is disturbed. A nearly black-flowering hybrid, known as Evelina, was bred in Italy in the late 1990s, with Papaver rhoeas, but does not appear to be available commercially.   Mohn.tk (German)"

It is native to the Mediterranean region, and western Asia as far as the western Himalayas, and has been introduced to much of the rest of Europe, South Africa, all of Australia, some US states, Chile and Argentina. It is a minor weed of cereal crops, and its range is expected to greatly expand due to climate change.In 1753 Carl Linnaeus named a species Papaver hybridum, but though not identical to Roemeria sicula, it is regarded as one of its synonyms. The first description identical to the present species was published by the botanist Giovanni Gussone in 1844 with the name Papaver siculum. However, it was regarded as a subspecies or variety of Papaver hybridum by some botanists as late as 2007. More recently it has been moved to the genus Roemeria by Gabriele Galasso, Enrico Augusto Banfi, Llorenç Sáez, and Fabrizio Bartolucci. Though Roemeria sicula is listed as the accepted name in Plants of the World Online and World Plants, it is very frequently listed as Papaver hybridum by sources such as the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Flora of North America, and the Flora of Australia. Following the species concept in POWO, it has 17 synonyms. == References =="

Oriental poppies grow a mound of leaves that are hairy and finely dissected in spring. They gather energy and bloom in mid-summer. After flowering, the foliage dies away entirely, a property that allows their survival in the summer drought of Central Asia. Gardeners can place late-developing plants nearby to fill the developing gap.The scientific name Papaver orientale was established in 1753 by Linnaeus. The species is classified in the genus Papaver within the wider family Papaveraceae. It has no varieties that are accepted, but does have four among its thirteen synonyms. Papaver orientale usually thrives in soil pH 6.5 to 7.5 and in full sun or part shade. Seeds are sown after the potential of frost has passed, the average temperature is approximately 21 °C and when soil has thoroughly warmed. The seeds are sown at a depth of about one centimeter, or less as light may stimulate germination. Oriental Poppies do not handle transplanting or over-watering well. Germination period is 10–20 days. Mulch can be used to protect the plant over the winter and deadheading will produce a second flower.

It is native to north Africa and temperate Eurasia and is introduced into temperate areas on all other continents except Antarctica. It is regarded as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including \"corn\" and \"field\"). As the plant thrives in areas of disturbed soil, it was often abundant in agricultural fields before the advent of herbicides. Flushes of poppies may still appear in fields where herbicides are not used, as well as those in fallow. The corn poppy and its cultivars such as the Shirley poppy are widely grown in gardens, and are frequently found in packets of seed labelled \"wildflower mixes\". Since World War I, it has been used in the Commonwealth as a symbol of remembrance for fallen soldiers because it commonly grew in fields disturbed by war.Papaver rhoeas is a variable, erect annual, forming a long-lived soil seed bank that can germinate when the soil is disturbed. In the Northern Hemisphere it generally flowers in late spring (between May and October in the UK) but if the weather is warm enough other flowers frequently appear at the beginning of autumn.

These are followed by elongated pod-like capsules, the two follicles eventually separating to reveal numerous seeds with long, silky hairs. The genus was named and described in 1810 by botanist Robert Brown in his paper On the Asclepiadeae published in Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society . He named the genus in honour of James Parsons (1705–1770), an English physician and Fellow of the Royal Society. The generic name Parsonsia R.Br.

The plant is called kodrava in Sanskrit, Arikelu in the Telugu language, Varagu in Tamil, Varak (വരക്) in Malayalam, Arka in Kannada, Kodo in Hindi and Kodra in Punjabi.Kodo millet is a monocot and an annual grass that grows to heights of approximately four feet. It has an inflorescence that produces 4–6 racemes that are 4–9 cm long. Its slender, light green leaves grow to be 20 to 40 centimeters in length. The seeds it produces are very small and ellipsoidal, being approximately 1.5 mm in width and 2 mm in length; they vary in colour from being light brown to a dark grey. Kodo millet has a shallow root system that may be ideal for intercropping. Paspalum scrobiculatum var. scrobiculatum is grown in India as an important crop, while Paspalum scrobiculatum var. commersonii is the "

The fruit is a pepo, a type of botanical berry, round to oval, either yellow or dark purple at maturity, with a soft to firm, juicy interior filled with numerous seeds. The plant is native to the region of southern Brazil through Paraguay to northern Argentina. It is cultivated commercially in tropical and subtropical areas for its sweet, seedy fruit. This is both eaten and juiced, with the juice often added to other fruit juices to enhance aroma.The passion fruit is so called because it is the fruit of one of the many species of passion flower, the English translation of the Latin genus name, Passiflora. Around 1700, the name was given by missionaries in Brazil as an educational aid while trying to convert the indigenous inhabitants to Christianity; its name was flor das cinco chagas or \"flower of the five wounds\" to illustrate the crucifixion of Christ, with other plant components also named after an emblem in the Passion of Jesus. Passiflora edulis is a perennial vine; tendrils are borne in leaf axils, and have a red or purple hue when young. There are two main varieties: a purple-fruited type, P. edulis f. edulis, and the yellow-fruited P. edulis f. flavicarpa. Usually the vine produces a single flower 5–7.5 cm wide at each node. The flower has 5 oblong, green sepals and 5 white petals. The sepals and petals are 4–6 mm in length and form a fringe. The base of the flower is a rich purp"

It has been introduced to tropical regions around the world, such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, Hawaii, Africa, and The Maldives. It is a creeping vine like other members of the genus, and yields an edible fruit. The specific epithet, foetida, means \"stinking\" in Latin and refers to the strong aroma emitted by damaged foliage. This passion flower tolerates arid ground, but favours moist areas. It is known to be an invasive species in some areas. This plant is also a widely grown perennial climber, and has been used in traditional medicine.The stems are thin and wiry, and are covered with minute sticky yellow hairs. Older stems become woody. The leaves are three- to five-lobed and viscid-hairy. When crushed, these leaves give off a pungent odor that some people consider unpleasant. The flowers are white to pale cream coloured, or pink to pale purple, about 5–6 cm diameter. The ripe fruit is globose, 2–3 cm diameter, remains green at maturity and has numerous black seeds embedded in the pulp; the fruit are eaten and the seeds dispersed by birds. Red-fruited plants have been classified as distinct species. Passiflora foetida is able to trap insects on"

While the young are often beneficial to crops by suppressing other plant feeders, the adults can be a problem when present in large numbers. Flower feeding leads to lower yield and this can be a problem in some leguminous crops. They are however easily controlled by manual collection.Body length is about 15.4 to 32.8 mm. Head and pronotum with moderately coarse deep and dense punctures. Eyes reniform. Maxillary palpi consists with strongly compressed, triangular apical segment. Pronotum has a middle region with depression along median impressed line. Elytra with moderately coarse, moderately deep and deeply punctures.

Its common English-language name came about because of a resemblance to rue (to which it is not related). Its seeds contain a high concentration (at least 5.9% by weight) of diverse beta-carboline alkaloids. It has deep roots and a strong smell, finely divided leaves, white flowers rich in alkaloids, and small seed capsules containing numerous dark, oily seeds. It is native to a vast region across North Africa, southern and eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and parts of South and East Asia, and has been introduced to countries like South Africa, Mexico, France. It grows in dry, often saline or disturbed habitats, thriving from sea level to high elevations, is pollinated mainly by insects (especially honey bees), disperses seeds mostly by dispersal vectors or human activity, and hosts a specialized beetle (Thamnurgus pegani) proposed for its biological control.

The leaves are deeply incised, velvety and soft to the touch (due to glandular hairs). The above-ground parts of the plant are more or less hairy and glandular. The alternately arranged leaves are divided into petioles and leaf blades. The leaf blade is soft, heart-shaped and palmately divided, blunt with lobed to coarsely toothed leaf lobes. The natural form smells of mint. Some cultivars have a scent similar to rose petals, although the leaf shape and scent vary (others have little or no scent). Some leaves are deeply incised and others less so, being slightly lobed like P. capitatum. The flowers vary from pale pink to almost white which appear from late winter to summer, peaking in spring. Pelargonium comes from the Greek πελαργός pelargos which means stork. Another name for pelargoniums is stork's-bills due to the shape of their fruit.

    "knowledge_text": "Strobilanthes is a genus of about 350 species of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae, mostly native to tropical Asia and Madagascar, but with a few species extending north into temperate regions of Asia. Many species are cultivated for their two-lipped, hooded flowers in shades of blue, pink, white and purple. Most are frost-tender and require protection in frost-prone areas. The genus is most famed for its many (but not all) species which bloom on long cycles of several years, such as Strobilanthes wightii which blooms every thirteen years.Strobilanthes atropurpurea is a temperate species, native to eastern Siberia; it is cultivated for its purple flowers. Strobilanthes dyeriana (Persian shield) is a tropical plant native to Myanmar. It is grown for its dark green foliage with bright, metallic-purple stripes radiating outward from the central leaf vein. In proper conditions, it will also produce pale purple flowers. Persian Shield grows best outdoors in USDA zones 9 and 10, although it can survive in other zones as a houseplant given sufficient temperature, soil moisture and humidity. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

It is an annual plant native to Southeast Asia and Indian highlands, and is traditionally grown in the Korean peninsula, southern China, Japan and India as a crop. A variety of this plant, P. frutescens var. crispa known as \"shiso\", is widely grown in Japan. An edible plant, perilla is grown in gardens and attracts butterflies. It has a strong mint-like smell. The major volatile compound responsible for this characteristic aroma is perilla ketone, which is present in particularly high amounts in the leaves of Perilla frutescens described in this article. In the United States, Perilla frutescens is a weed pest, toxic to cattle after ingestion.Perilla is an annual plant growing 60–90 cm (24–35 in) tall, with stalks which are hairy and square. The leaves are opposite, 7–12 cm (3–4+1⁄2 in) long and 5–8 cm (2–3 in) wide, with a broad oval shape, pointy ends, serrated (saw-toothed) margins, and long leafstalks. The leaves are green with occasional touches of purple on the underside. The flowers bloom on racemes at the end of branches and the main stalk in late summer.

It has an upright habit, typically reaching 0.5–1.2 metres (1+1⁄2–4 feet) tall, with square stems and gray-green leaves that yield a distinctive odor when crushed. It is best known for its flowers. Its flowering season extends from mid-summer to late October, with blue to violet blossoms arranged into showy, branched panicles. It is native to the steppes and hills of southwestern and central Asia. Successful over a wide range of climate and soil conditions, it has since become popular and widely planted. Several cultivars have been developed, differing primarily in leaf shape and overall height; 'Blue Spire' is the most common. This variation has been widely used in gardens and landscaping. S. yangii was the Perennial Plant Association's 1995 Plant of the Year, and the 'Blue Spire' cultivar received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society. The species has a long history of use in traditional medicine in its native range, where it is employed as a treatment for a variety of ailments.

It has been introduced and naturalized in Europe and elsewhere in the world with suitable climates, and is widely cultivated as a herb and a vegetable. It is believed to have been originally grown in Sardinia, and was cultivated in around the 3rd century BC. Linnaeus stated its wild habitat to be Sardinia, whence it was brought to England and apparently first cultivated in Britain in 1548, though literary evidence suggests parsley was used in England in the Middle Ages as early as the Anglo-Saxon period. Parsley is widely used in European, Middle Eastern, and American cuisine. Curly-leaf parsley is often used as a garnish. In central Europe, eastern Europe, and southern Europe, as well as in western Asia, many dishes are served with fresh green chopped parsley sprinkled on top. Flat-leaf parsley is similar, but is often preferred by chefs because it has a stronger flavor. Root parsley is very common in central, eastern, and southern European cuisines, where it is eaten as a snack, or as a vegetable in many soups, stews, and casseroles.The word \"parsley\" is a merger of Old English petersilie (which is identical to the contemporary German word for parsley: Petersilie) and the Old French peresil.

In areas where both are considered to be lima beans, the green variety may be labeled as \"baby\" (and less commonly \"junior\") limas.Phaseolus lunatus is found in Meso- and South America. Two gene pools of cultivated lima beans point to independent domestication events. The Mesoamerican lima bean is distributed in neotropical lowlands, while the other is found in the western Andes. They were discovered in Peru and may have been the first plant that was brought up under civilization by the native farmers. The Andean domestication took place around 2000 BC and produced a large-seeded variety (lima type), while the second, taking place in Mesoamerica around AD 800, produced a small-seeded variety (Sieva type). By around 1300, cultivation had spread north of the Rio Grande, and, in the 1500s, the plant began to be cultivated in the Old World. The small-seeded (Sieva) type is found distributed from Mexico to Argentina, generally below 1,600 m (5,200 ft) above sea level, while the large-seeded wild form (lima type) is found distributed in the north of Peru, from 320 to 2,030 m (1,050 to 6,660 ft) above sea level.

Its botanical classification, along with other Phaseolus species, is as a member of the legume family, Fabaceae. It forms a green-leaved vine which produces beans inside of pods. The common bean has a long history of cultivation. All wild members of the species have a climbing habit, but many cultivars are classified either as bush beans or climbing beans, depending on their style of growth. In 2022, 28 million tonnes of dry common beans were produced worldwide, led by India with 23% of the total. Raw dry beans contain the toxic compound phytohaemagglutinin, which can be deactivated by boiling the beans for 30 minutes. In addition to the beans, the unripe green pods are used for food. The leaf is occasionally used as a vegetable and the straw as fodder.Bush varieties form erect bushes 20–60 centimetres (8–20 inches) tall, while pole, or running, varieties form vines 2–3 metres (7–10 feet) long. All wild members of the species have a climbing habit. All varieties bear alternate, green or purple leaves, which are divided into three oval, smooth-edged leaflets, each 6–15 cm (2–6 in) long and 3–11 cm (1–4 in) wide. The white, pink, or purple flowers are about a centimetre long and have 10 stamens each. The flowers are self-pollinating, which facilitates the selection of stable cultivars.

It is naturalised in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. P. dactylifera is the type species of genus Phoenix, which contains 12–19 species of wild date palms. Date palms reach up to 30 metres (98 ft) in height, growing singly or forming a clump with several stems from a single root system. Slow-growing, they can reach over 100 years of age when maintained properly. Date fruit (dates) are oval-cylindrical, 3 to 7 centimetres (1 to 3 inches) long, and about 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter, with colour ranging from dark brown to bright red or yellow, depending on variety. Containing 63-64% sugar by mass when dried, dates are consumed as sweet snacks on their own or with confections. There is archaeological evidence of date cultivation in Arabia from the 6th millennium BCE.

It is similar to the related species Phyla lanceolata, but differs in having much shorter leaves that are often blunt and much more rounded. Both species are common as weeds and in the ornamental environment. P. nodiflora has been found throughout North America, Asia, and Africa. It is most commonly found in moist habitats with poorly to well-drained soils. P. nodiflora acts as a common nectar source and is the host plant for various butterflies, including the white peacock.

The branchlets bear alternate leaves that are ovate or lanceolate in form, with short petioles and pointed ends. The leaves are 2–7.5 cm long and thin, they are green and smooth on the upperside and blue-green on the underside. In general, the Otaheite gooseberry tree very much looks like the bilimbi tree. The flowers can be male, female or hermaphrodite. They are small and pinkish and appear in clusters in 5-to-12.5-cm long panicles. Flowers are formed at leafless parts of the main branches, at the upper part of the tree. The fruits are numerous, oblate, with 6 to 8 ribs, and densely clustered.

Within that region, it is called aguaymanto, uvilla or uchuva, in addition to numerous indigenous and regional names. In English, its common names include Cape gooseberry, goldenberry and Peruvian groundcherry. The history of Physalis peruviana cultivation in South America can be traced to the Inca Empire. It has been cultivated in England since the late 18th century, and in South Africa in the Cape of Good Hope since at least the start of the 19th century. Widely introduced in the 20th century, Physalis peruviana is now cultivated or grows wild across the world in temperate and tropical regions.Physalis peruviana was given a botanical species description by Carl Linnaeus in 1763. and given the genus name Physalis after the Greek: φυσαλλίς - physallís, “bladder, wind instrument” in reference to the calyx that surrounds the berry. The specific name peruviana refer to the country of Peru, one of the countries of the berry's origin. In Peru, P. peruviana is known as aguaymanto in Spanish and topotopo in Quechua.

Some sources maintain that the widespread species P. physaloides is found also in Japan, but the species is not recorded as being native in one of the few English-language floras of the country. The genus has medicinal value, being rich in tropane alkaloids, and is also of ornamental value, three species having been grown for ornament, although hitherto infrequently outside botanical gardens. Furthermore, the genus contains a species (P. physaloides – recorded in older literature under the synonyms Hyoscyamus physalodes, Hyoscyamus physaloides and Scopolia physaloides) formerly used as an entheogen in Siberia (re. which see translation of Gmelin's account of such use below).The name Physochlaina is a compound of the Greek words φυσα (phusa), 'bladder' / 'bubble' / 'inflated thing' and χλαινα ( chlaina ), 'robe' / 'loose outer garment' / 'cloak' / 'wrapper' – giving the meaning 'clad loosely in a puffed-up bladder' – in reference to the calyces of the plants, which become enlarged and sometimes bladder-like in fruit – like those of the much better known Solanaceous genera Physalis, Withania and Nicandra, f"

The dried pericarp is wrinkled, and its color ranges from grayish brown to black. The seed is hard, white and oily. The odor of cubeb is described as agreeable and aromatic and the taste as pungent, acrid, slightly bitter and persistent. It has been described as tasting like allspice, or like a cross between allspice and black pepper. Cubeb came to Europe via India through the trade with the Arabs. The name cubeb comes from Arabic kabāba (كبابة) by way of Old French quibibes. Cubeb is mentioned in alchemical writings by its Arabic name. In his Theatrum Botanicum, John Parkinson tells that the king of Portugal (Possibly either Philip IV of Spain or John IV of Portugal, as that year was marked by the start of the Portuguese Restoration War) prohibited the sale of cubeb to promote black pepper (Piper nigrum) around 1640.

Long pepper has a taste similar to, but sweeter and more pungent than, that of its close relative Piper nigrum – from which black, green and white pepper are obtained. The fruit of the pepper consists of many minuscule fruits – each about the size of a poppy seed – embedded in the surface of a flower spike that closely resembles a hazel tree catkin. Like Piper nigrum, the fruits contain the compound piperine, which contributes to their pungency. Another species of long pepper, Piper retrofractum, is native to Java, Indonesia. The fruits of this plant are often confused with chili peppers, which belong to the genus Capsicum, originally from the Americas.Use of long pepper occurred in Greece in the sixth or fifth century BCE, though Hippocrates discussed it as a medicine rather than a spice. Among the Greeks and Romans and prior to the Columbian exchange, long pepper was a common spice. The ancient history of long pepper is often interlinked with that of black pepper (Piper nigrum). Theophrastus distinguished the two in his work of botany. The Romans knew of both but their word for pepper usually meant black pepper. Pliny erroneously believed dried black pepper and long pepper came from the same plant. Round, or black, pepper began to compete with long pepper in Europe from t"

Under this name it is cultivated for its leaf which is used in Lao and Vietnamese cuisine as a flavoring wrap for grilling meats, namely the thịt bò nướng lá lốt in Vietnam.There is no \"official\" English name for it, but it is sometimes called wild betel. It is known as chaphlu (ชะพลู, pronounced [t͡ɕʰá.pʰlūː]) or cha phlu (ช้าพลู, pronounced [t͡ɕʰáː pʰlūː]) in Thai; phak i leut or pak eelerd (ຜັກອີ່ເລີດ) in Lao; and pokok kadok in Malay. In Vietnam, the local name of Piper lolot – lá lốt – is applied to P. sarmentosum also. It is also known as lolot pepper. In Vietnamese it is called lá lốt (or sometimes in the South lá lốp).

It has globose drupes about 3mm in diameter. Flowers in August and September in China, in the Manas National Park of northwest Assam, flowering and fruiting occur from August to October, while in Bangladesh flowers and fruits appear from May to September. This species is distinguished anatomically by having very finely (magnification needed) powdered pubescent leaves. Other distinctive features, differentiating the species from other Piper species in Bangladesh, is yellow flowers and deeply cordate and lobed leaf bases at a macroscopic level, while bicollateral leaf vascular bundles, and para- and tetracytic stomata were identified as distinctive at microscopic anatomical level. The species was first described by William Roxburgh in 1820. The plant is native to Bangladesh and the Eastern Himalaya region. The Flora of China warns that the application of this name to Chinese plants is unclear, however it states that the climber is found in Tibet (see also) and South Yunnan, as well as Bangladesh, India and Myanmar.

It contains 10 to 20 species that are native to Africa and Eurasia from the Canary Islands, all of Africa, and southern Europe, warm and semidesert areas across Asia, and North America from Guatemala to Mexico, as well as southern Texas.Pistacia plants are shrubs and small trees growing to 5–15 m (16–49 ft) tall. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on species. All species are dioecious, but monoecious individuals of Pistacia atlantica have been noted. The genus is estimated to be about 80 million years old. It is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Anacardiaceae. The plants are dioecious, and have male and female trees independently; a viable population should have both sexes. Well-known species in the genus Pistacia include P. vera, the pistachio, grown for its edible seeds; P. terebinthus, from which terebinth resin, a turpentine, is produced; P. lentiscus, source of the plant resin mastic; and P. chinensis, the Chinese pistache, cultivated as an ornamental tree. Scientists from Iran and China assembled a draft genome of pistachio and resequenced 107 whole genomes, including 93 domestic and 14 wild individuals of P. vera and 35 other genomes from different wild Pistacia species.

It resists mild to heavy frosts but prefers milder winters and grows on all types of soils, and can grow well in limestone areas and even in salty or saline environments, making it more abundant near the sea. It is also found in woodlands, dehesas (almost deforested pasture areas), Kermes oak woods, wooded areas dominated by other oaks, garrigues, maquis shrublands, hills, gorges, canyons, and rocky hillsides of the entire Mediterranean area. It is a typical species of Mediterranean mixed communities which include myrtle, Kermes oak, Mediterranean dwarf palm, buckthorn and sarsaparilla, and serves as protection and food for birds and other fauna in this ecosystem. It is a very hardy pioneer species dispersed by birds. When older, it develops some large trunks and numerous thicker and longer branches. In appropriate areas, when allowed to grow freely and age, it often becomes a tree of up to 7 m (23 ft). However, logging, grazing, and fires often prevent its development. The leaves are alternate,"

It has deciduous, pinnate leaves 10–20 centimetres (4–8 inches) long. The plants are dioecious, with separate male and female trees. The flowers are apetalous and unisexual and borne in panicles. The fruit is a drupe, containing an elongated seed, which is the edible portion. The seed, commonly thought of as a nut, is a culinary nut, not a botanical nut. The fruit has a hard, cream-colored exterior shell. The seed has a mauve-colored skin and light green flesh, with a distinctive flavor. When the fruit ripens, the shell changes from green to an autumnal yellow/red and abruptly splits partly open. This is known as dehiscence and happens with an audible pop. Humans selected the trait of splitting open. Commercial cultivars vary in how consistently they split open. Each mature pistachio tree averages around 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of seeds, or around 50,000 seeds, every two years.

Its native distribution is uncertain but is probably pantropical; it was first scientifically described from plants found on the Nile near Lake Victoria in Africa. It is now present, either naturally or through human introduction, in nearly all tropical and subtropical fresh waterways and is considered an invasive species as well as a mosquito breeding habitat.

It floats on the surface of the water, its roots hanging submersed beneath floating leaves. The leaves can measure 2 – 15 cm long and are light green, with parallel venations and wavy margins. The surface of the leaves is covered in short, white hairs which form basket-like structures that can trap air bubbles and increase the plant's buoyancy. The spongy parenchyma with large intercellular spaces in the leaves also aids the plant in floating.

The name \"Pea\" is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), the seeds from several species of Lathyrus, and Sturt's desert pea (Swainsona formosa). Each pod contains several seeds (peas), which can have green or yellow cotyledons when mature. Botanically, pea pods are fruit, since they contain seeds and develop from the ovary of a \"pea\" flower. Peas are annual plants, with a life cycle of one year. They are a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 100 and 360 milligrams (1+1⁄2–5+1⁄2 grains). The immature peas (and in snow peas and snap peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from a matured pod.

The inflorescences are borne on stalks typically 5–40 centimetres (2–15+1⁄2 inches) tall, and can be a short cone or a long spike, with numerous tiny wind-pollinated flowers. The boundaries of the genus Plantago have been fairly stable, with the main question being whether to include Bougueria (one species from the Andes) and Littorella (2–3 species of aquatic plants). There are about 200 species of Plantago, including: The genus name Plantago descends from the classical Latin name plantago, which in classical Latin meant some Plantago species, including Plantago major and Plantago media. In Latin the name was formed from the classical Latin word planta = \"sole of the foot\". The name was so formed in Latin because the leaves of these species grow out near flat at ground level.

Flowers are 4 millimetres (1⁄8 in), with a green calyx and brownish corolla, four bent-back lobes with brown midribs and long white stamens. The mode of reproduction can vary among populations. Reproduction occurs sexually, with the pollen being wind dispersed for the most part, though the plant is occasionally pollinated by bees. Plantago lanceolata contains phenylethanoids such as acteoside (verbascoside), cistanoside F, lavandulifolioside, plantamajoside and isoacteoside. It also contains the iridoid glycosides aucubin and catalpol.

The tree was called platane in ancient Greek history and literature and by related names in continental Europe. It is also well known in Asia from Anatolia to India, where usually called chinar or chenar. The native distribution is from Italy east through the Balkans, Turkey, and the Caucasus to Iran. As it has been known in cultivation from early times in much of this region it can be difficult to determine if it is truly indigenous in peripheral areas. The oriental plane is found naturally in riverine settings, together with such trees as alder, willow and poplar. However, it is quite capable of survival and success in dry soils once it is established. It can grow into a massive tree with many examples hundreds of years old.

The herbaceous species may be annual or perennial. The leaves are opposite. The inflorescences are \"thryses\" – compound structures in which the flowers are arranged on secondary branches. Individual flowers have stalks (pedicels). The sepals form a two-lipped funnel shape, the upper lip having four lobes, the lower lip one lobe. The petals form a two-lipped tube, with an S-shaped basal portion. There are four stamens, whose filaments are not fused together. The style is divided into two parts (bifid). The nutlets are ovoid. Equilabium and Plectranthus species are distinguished from Coleus by having the stem (pedicel) of the calyx attached symmetrically to the base of the calyx tube, rather than opposite the upper lip, and having the corolla lobes more or less equal in length. Equilabium species can be distinguished from Plectranthus by the truncated shape of the throat of the calyx and by the usually S-shaped tube of the corolla, which is parallel-sided at the base.

The species hybridizes with Pluchea carolinensis when the two plants grow together, yielding a hybrid that has been named Pluchea × fosbergii.This species is a branching shrub up to 2 meters tall. The toothed oval leaf blades are papery but not thin, and often have a fine coating of hairs. The flower heads grow in dense clusters in the leaf axils and at the branch tips. The pinkish purple florets have long, protruding styles. Florets along the edges of the head produce fruits. The fruit body is a millimeter in length with a white pappus about 5 millimeters long. The seeds are dispersed on the wind. The plant contains the compounds β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, which have antidiabetic properties. The β-sitosterol isolated from the root extract can also neutralize the venom of Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) and the monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia). The plant often grows in wet saline coastal habitat, such as brackish marshes and mangroves. Though it is not very competitive with other flora, it can easily colonize coastal habitat and impact native and cultivated plants. It alters waterbird habitat.

Previously the species was thought to range eastwards as far as Fiji. David J. de Laubenfels identified the eastern populations from New Guinea to Fiji as a separate species, Podocarpus idenburgensis, distinguished by narrow, acute leaves.It grows 10–15 metres (33–49 feet) tall, though very occasionally taller, in tropical and subtropical wet closed forests, between 650 m (2,130 ft) and 1,600 m (5,200 ft)elevation. In Cambodia however it grows in a dwarf form some 2–4 m (6 ft 7 in – 13 ft 1 in) tall, at Bokor, some 1,000 m (3,300 ft) elevation. It can grow in a variety of places like rocky hill-tops, swampy forest, kerangas, on limestone and sandstone soils. It has a yellowish wood, used in construction in Cambodia (called srô:l in Khmer), where it is graded 2nd category (not as good as 1st, but above others). == References =="

It exhibits symmetrical pyramidal growth with willowy weeping pendulous branches and long narrow lanceolate leaves with undulate margins. Monoon longifolium is sometimes incorrectly identified as the ashoka tree (Saraca indica) because of the close resemblance of both trees. The cultivated, column-like pendula form can appear to have no branches, but in fact a non-hybrid M. longifolium allowed to grow naturally (without trimming the branches out for decorative reasons) grows into a normal large tree giving plenty of shade.Common names include false ashoka, the Buddha tree, Indian mast tree, and Indian fir tree.

Under the Cronquist system and some other plant classification systems, the order Fabales contains only the family Fabaceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Fabales were in the superorder Fabiflorae (also called Fabanae) with three families corresponding to the subfamilies of Fabaceae in APG II. The other families treated in the Fabales by the APG II classification were placed in separate orders by Cronquist, the Polygalaceae within its own order, the Polygalales, and the Quillajaceae and Surianaceae within the Rosales. The Fabaceae, as the third-largest plant family in the world, contain most of the diversity of the Fabales, the other families making up a comparatively small portion of the order's diversity. Research in the order is largely focused on the Fabaceae, due in part to its great biological diversity, and to its importance as food plants.

It is a rhizomatous perennial growing to 90 cm (35 in) tall by 25 cm (10 in) broad, with arching stems of alternate leaves, and slightly necked, pendent tubular white flowers with green tips, hanging from the undersides of the stems. It is valued in cultivation for its ability to colonise shady areas, and is suitable for a woodland style planting. Its fruit persists for an average of 17.5 days, and bears an average of 2.6 seeds per fruit. Fruits average 83.5% water, and their dry weight includes 43.6% carbohydrates and 1.2% lipids. The shoots of Polygonatum multiflorum look very attractive, so they are suitable for use in floral arrangements. The longevity of cut shoots of Polygonatum multiflorum ‘Variegatum’ harvested from the field ranges from 15 to 22 days. To extend the life of cut shoots, gibberellic acid, benzyladenine (BA) and hydroxyquinoline sulphate are used. They prolong postharvest longevity mainly by delaying leaf yellowing. The hybrid Polygonatum × hybridum (P. multiflorum × P. odoratum) has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Matthew Wood. The Book of Herbal Wisdom. Random "

It is an annual found in fields and wasteland, with white flowers from June to October. It is widespread across many countries in temperate regions, apparently native to Eurasia, naturalized in temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere.Common knotgrass is an annual, low-prostrate herb with semi-erect, branching stems, which forms patches up to about 2 m across as it matures. It has alternate linear-lanceolate leaves which are longer (7-15 mm) on the main stems than on the branches (3-5 mm). The whole plant is hairless and green, although it may appear mealy due to a powdery mildew, which can give the leaves a whitish appearance. The leaves fall early, especially on the main stem. The leaf stalks (petioles) are up to 5 mm long or sometimes absent. Above each leaf there is an ochrea, which is a translucent papery stipule that surrounds the stem. The inflorescences occur in the leaf axils and consist of a group of 1-6 flowers, each on a very short (1 mm) stalk (pedicel). The flowers are green with white or pink margins, ranging in size from 2 to 4.5 mm. Each flower has five overlapping perianth segments, fused into a cup for about a third of their length, with 8 stamens and 3 carpels.

It has a widespread distribution across much of North America and South America. Its preferred habitat is in moist, saturated to inundated soils growing in full sun to partial shade; such as swamp forests, marshes, streams, shorelines, and ditches. It is sometimes semi-aquatic. Swamp smartweed is quite variable and is sometimes divided into several varieties, some of which may be better treated as species in their own right. In general, swamp smartweed is a rhizomatous perennial herb growing upright or erect and approaching a maximum height of one meter (40 inches). Roots may emerge from nodes on the lower stem. The bristly lance-shaped leaves are around 10 centimeters (4 inches) long. The leaves have sheathing stipules known as ochreae. The spike-like inflorescence produces many pinkish flowers each about 3 millimeters wide. Swamp smartweed is reported to be edible, as are all species in the genus Persicaria. Although its close relatives Persicaria hydropiper and Persicaria punctata are known to possess a hot or pungent quality when consumed, swamp smartweed is said to lack the same pungency by at least one author.

It is an invasive weed in the mountains of Sri Lanka. Koenigia polystachya is a rhizomatous perennial herb producing thick, hollow, erect stems easily exceeding one meter (40 inches) in length. Via its rhizomes it can form dense colonies. It may also spread asexually if sections of the stem containing rooting nodes are separated and moved to a new area; chopping the plant into small pieces does not necessarily keep it from growing. The hairy leaves are up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) long. The branching inflorescence is an array of lacy clusters of many small white flowers.

The fronds, with triangular leaflets, measure 10 to 50 centimetres (3.9 to 19.7 in). They grow apart from each other and are divided all the way back to the central stem in 10 to 18 pairs of segments or leaflets which measure 10–20 centimetres (3.9–7.9 in) long and 5–7 centimetres (2.0–2.8 in) wide The leaflets become much shorter at the end of the frond. The leaflets are generally whole or slightly denticulated and somewhat wider at their base, where they often touch each other. They have an alternating arrangement, those on one side being slightly offset from those on the other side. The petioles have no scales. The sori are found on the lower side of the fronds and range in colour from bright yellow to orange. They became dark grey at maturity Period of sporulation: July to September.

Ming aralia is commonly grown as an ornamental and a potherb, valued for its culinary and medicinal uses.Ming aralia exhibits a fruticose or shrubby growth habit with upright branches, hence its species name, fruticosa. The compound leaves consist of many leaflets that are finely divided themselves, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. The leaflets are glossy dark green on the upper surface and lighter beneath, hence the genus name Polyscias, which means \"many-shaded\", a common feature of the foliage of other plants in this genus. The overall leaf form is tripinnate, sometimes up to five-pinnate. Individual leaflets vary from narrowly ovate to lanceolate and are about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long, with serrated or lobed margins. The leaves have an alternate arrangement, borne on slender, slightly woody stalks that measure 5–15 centimetres (2.0–5.9 in) long. The petioles carry compound leaves with up to seven or more opposite leaflets, arranged along a central stalk (rachis). On some specimens, the petioles, rachises, and petiolules have a reddish hue.

Its common names include pink purslane, kiss-me-quick and hairy pigweed. Its range extends from the southern United States and the Caribbean to as far south as Brazil. It is a succulent plant with linear leaves and pink flowers.The name is derived from pilose, which means to be covered with long soft hairs. Portulaca pilosa is a highly variable species. It exhibits morphological variability during its development. The immature plants have wider, longer and flatter leaves than its mature counterparts. Leaves of mature plants are narrower, shorter and more hemispheric in cross section. Physical differences are observed due to variable habitat types this species can be found in. Plants that grow in an arid environment tend to have the greatest density of hairs. Plants that grow in a moist environment tend to have less hairs. Plants with very dense hair under a certain condition will produce fewer hair growth under a moist condition, showing growth variability. The plant habit is also governed by its habitat. Plants growing in moist, warm environments tend to branch quickly into a spreading habit, with an erect secondary growth. Plants in dry and cool environments are the opposite, they grow erect first and then branch more slowly. This type has a more compact habit.

It has creeping red stolons that can be up to 80 cm (31 in) long. The leaves are 10–20 cm (4–8 in) long, evenly pinnate into in saw-toothed leaflets 2–5 cm long and 1–2 cm broad with 6–14 teeth per side, covered with silky white hairs, particularly on the underside. These hairs are also present on the stem and the stolons. These give the leaves the silvery appearance from which the plant gets its name. Each leaf is borne on a channeled petiole up to 5 cm in length with a long sheathing base. The flowers are produced singly on 5–15 cm long stems, 1.5–2.5 cm diameter with five (rarely up to seven) yellow petals. The fruit is a cluster of dry achenes. The plant was originally placed in the genus Potentilla by Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum (1753), but was reclassified into the resurrected genus Argentina by research conducted in the 1990s. The reclassification remains controversial and is not accepted by some authorities. It is a species aggregate which has frequently been divided into multiple species.

They have been extensively cultivated and hybridised (in the case of the primrose, for many hundreds of years). Primula are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia, and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America. Almost half of the known species are from the Himalayas. Primula has over 500 species in traditional treatments, and more if certain related genera are included within its circumscription.Primula is a complex and varied genus, with a range of habitats from alpine slopes to boggy meadows. Plants bloom mostly during the spring, with flowers often appearing in spherical umbels on stout stems arising from basal rosettes of leaves; their flowers can be purple, yellow, red, pink, blue, or white. Some species show a white mealy bloom (farina) on various parts of the plant. Many species are adapted to alpine climates. Primula was known at least as early as the mediaeval herbalists, although first formally described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753, and later in 1754 in his Flora Anglica.

Its range extends in the Himalayas from Himachal Pradesh in north-central India, to south-western China, Burma and Thailand. In India the tree is widely revered in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. The tree is found in temperate forest from 1,200 to 2,400 metres (3,900 to 7,900 ft) in elevation and extends to tropical highlands of Southeast Asia.Prunus cerasoides is a tree which grows up to 30 metres (98 ft) in height. It has glossy, ringed bark. When the tree is not in flower, it is characterised by glossy, ringed bark and long, dentate stipules. The tree flowers twice a year, during autumn and spring. First flowering blooms between the months of January to April and second flowering blooms between September and November. Flowers are hermaphroditic and are pinkish white in color. It has ovoid yellow fruit that turns red as it ripens. Prunus cerasoides thrives in well-drained and moisture-retentive loamy soil, in an open, sunny, and sheltered location. P. cerasoides, like most members of the genus Prunus, is shallow rooted and is likely to produce suckers if the root is damaged. It is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present. It is known to be susceptible to honey fungus. The seed requires two to three months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as early in winter as possible. The seed grows rather"

    "knowledge_text": "Prunus cerasus (sour cherry, tart cherry, or dwarf cherry) is an Old World species of Prunus in the subgenus Cerasus (cherries). It has two main groups of cultivars: the dark-red Morello cherry and the lighter-red Amarelle cherry. The sour pulp is edible.The tree is smaller than the sweet cherry (growing to a height of 4–10 m), has twiggy branches, and its crimson-to-near-black cherries are borne upon shorter stalks. It is closely related to the sweet cherry (Prunus avium), but has a fruit that is more acidic. Its fruit persists for an average of 17.4 days, and always bears 1 seed per fruit. Fruits average 84.9% water, and their dry weight includes 39.7% carbohydrates and 1.0% lipids. Prunus cerasus, a tetraploid with 2n=32 chromosomes, is thought to have originated as a natural hybrid between Prunus avium and Prunus fruticosa in the Iranian Plateau or Eastern Europe where the two species come into contact. Prunus fruticosa is believed to have provided its smaller size and sour tasting fruit. The hybrids then stabilized and interbred to form a new, distinct species. There are two main varieties (groups of cultivars) of the sour cherry: the dark-red Morello cherry and the lighter-red Amarelle cherry. It is distributed in much of Europe, North Africa and West Asia. There are likely no truly wild occurrences. However, particularly the subspecies acida easily escapes cultivation and is naturalized throughout the growing area. Cultivated sour cherries were selected from wild speci"

A deciduous tree, it includes many varieties of the fruit trees known as plums in English, though not all plums belong to this species. The greengages and damsons also belong to subspecies of P. domestica.It typically forms a large shrub or a small tree. It may be somewhat thorny, with white blossom, borne in early spring. The oval or spherical fruit varies in size, but can be up to 8 centimetres (3 inches) across. The pulp is usually sweet, but some varieties are sour. Like all Prunus fruits, it contains a single large seed, usually called a stone, which is discarded when eating. The species' hybrid parentage was believed to be Prunus spinosa and P. cerasifera; however, recent cytogenetic evidence seem to implicate 2×, 4×, 6× P. cerasifera as the sole wild stock from which the cultivated 6× P. domestica could have evolved. Cullen et al. (1995) recognises three subspecies, though scientific studies favor a more fine-grained separation: The subspecies cross easily, so that numerous intermediate forms can be found: their sweetness and tartness may vary, their colors varying from bluish-purple to red, orange, yellow or light green. Numerous cultivars have been selected for garden use.

The fruit of the almond is a drupe, consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then removed to reveal the white embryo. Once almonds are cleaned and processed, they can be stored for around a year if kept refrigerated; at higher temperatures they will become rancid more quickly. Almonds are used in many cuisines, often featuring prominently in desserts, such as marzipan. The almond tree prospers in a moderate Mediterranean climate with cool winter weather. It is rarely found wild in its original setting. Almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit trees, due to the ability to produce quality offspring entirely from seed, without using suckers and cuttings. Evidence of domesticated almonds in the Early Bronze Age has been found in the archeological sites of the Middle East, and subsequently across the Mediterranean region and similar arid climates with cool winters.

The tree is regarded as handsome and is planted in gardens for its springtime blooms in addition to fruit production. It is relatively short lived, usually not exceeding twenty years of age. Peaches were first domesticated and cultivated in China during the Neolithic period. The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs to the genus Prunus, which also includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum, and which is part of the rose family. The peach is very popular; only the apple and pear have higher production amounts for temperate fruits. In 2023, China produced 65% of the world total of peaches and nectarines. Other leading countries, such as Spain, Turkey, Italy, the U.S., and Iran lag far behind China, with none producing more than 5% of the world total. The fruit is regarded as a symbol of longevity in several East Asian cultures.The peach is a deciduous tree or tree like shrub that may very rarely grow to as much as 10 meters (33 ft) tall, but is more typically 3 m (10 ft) with large specimens reaching 4 m (13 ft).

The Latin genus name Prunus derives from the Ancient Greek προύνη (proúnē), meaning plum. The specific epithet, salicina, is derived from the Latin word for willow, since the leaves of Prunus salicina have a narrow, lanceolate, and taper-pointed shape, which is similar to the leaves of some willow species. Prunus salicina grows up to 9–12 metres (30–39 ft) tall, and its branches are purplish brown to reddish brown and its lateral shoots are yellowish red. The leaves are 6–12 cm long and 2.5–5 cm broad, with scalloped margins, which when young is often mixed with simple gland-tipped teeth.

Various cultivars have white, pink, or red flesh; a few varieties feature red (instead of green or yellow) skin. When cultivated from seed, guavas are notable for their extremely slow growth rate for several months, before a very rapid acceleration in growth rate takes over. From seed, common guavas may bloom and set fruit in as few as two years or as many as eight. Cuttings, grafting, and air layering are more commonly used as a propagation method in commercial groves. Highly adaptable, guavas can be easily grown as container plants in temperate regions, though their ability to bloom and set fruit is somewhat less predictable. The leaves of P. guajava contain the flavonol morin, morin-3-O-lyxoside, morin-3-O-arabinoside, quercetin and quercetin-3-O-arabinoside.

Originally native to Eurasia and North America, the extreme lightness of its spores has led to it achieving a cosmopolitan distribution.Common bracken is a herbaceous perennial plant, deciduous in winter. The large, roughly triangular fronds are produced singly, arising upwards from an underground rhizome, and grow to 0.3–1 metre (1–3+1⁄2 feet) tall; the main stem, or stipe, is up to 1 centimetre (1⁄2 inch) in diameter at the base. It dies back to ground level in autumn. The rhizome grows up to 3.5 metres (11+1⁄2 ft) deep, about 5 cm (2 in) in diameter, and up to 15 m (50 ft) long. Because it regrows in the spring from an underground rhizome, P. aquilinum tends to be found in dense colonies of genetically identical fronds. Such colonies can be as much as 650 years of age, with individual rhizomes living up to 72 years. One colony at Raakkyla, North Karelia, Finland studied by Eino Oinonen proved to be 489 m (1,604 ft) in diameter and based on growth rate, over 1400 years of age. In the spring as the plant enters its growing cycle, fiddleheads are first sent up from the rhizome. The density and area covered by a single rhizome maximizes that rhizome's chance of biological success when sending up new growth. The new growth presents as vertical stalks, coiled and covered in silve"

The Lepcha of Sikkim call it book koong. It is placed in subgenus Cerris, section Cyclobalanopsis. Quercus lamellosa is a medium-sized to large evergreen tree growing to 40 m tall with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter. The leaves are spirally arranged, ovate-elliptic, 16–45 cm long and 6–15 cm broad, with a sharply serrated margin. The flowers are catkins, the female flowers maturing into broad acorns 2–3 cm long and 3–4 cm broad, set in a deep cupule with concentric rings of woody scales. Joseph Dalton Hooker commented, \"The present is one of the commonest trees about Dorjiling, and is certainly by far the noblest species of Oak known, whether from the size of the foliage or acorns, the texture and colour, or the imposing appearance of the tree.\" Quercus lamellosa is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental tree in warm-temperate climates; in the British Isles, cultivation is only successful in the milder parts of Ireland and Cornwall. photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri, collected in Darjeeling in 1961, showing leaves photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri, collected in Darjeeling in 1961, showing acorns"

The male flowers are slender and drooping spikes. The female spikes are sessile and axillary. There is a solitary acorn. Quercus leucotrichophora flowers in April to May and fruits in December. Naturally, it regenerates via seeds. Quercus leucotrichophora is distributed in Northern India, Nepal, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In Nepal, it naturally occurs at 1,500–2,700 metres (4,900–8,900 feet) in forested areas in association with Rhododendron arboreum, Lyonia ovalifolia, and Myrica esculenta. On south-facing slopes and disturbed areas it forms associations with Pinus roxburghii (chir pine). The fungus Lactarius abbotanus forms ectomycorrhizae with the roots of this tree. Its branches are festooned with a variety of mosses, lichens, epiphytes, parasitic creepers, and other life forms that provide spaces for many creatures.

The flowers are tubular, consisting of oblong petals 6–8 mm long. They are fragrant and have long receptacles to adapt for pollinators with long tongues. They change in colour with age and it is thought that this is a strategy to gather more pollinators. The flower is initially white and opens at dusk to attract hawkmoths. On the second day it turns pink, and on the third it turns red attracting day flying bees and birds. The flower also changes from a horizontal orientation to a drooping pose.

Radishes are often used raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with a pungent, slightly spicy flavor, varying in intensity depending on its growing environment. There are numerous varieties varying in size, flavor, color, and length of time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, common smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several weeks. Being relatively easy to grow and quick to harvest, radishes are often planted by novice gardeners. Another use of radish is as a cover or catch crop in winter, or as a forage crop.

The genus can mainly be found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and various oceanic islands.The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants stipulates that the genus name was established by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 book Species Plantarum, which cites his earlier description which states in Botanical Latin that the name is dedicated \"to Leonhard Rauwolf\": \"Leon. Rauvolfio\". Although some subsequent authors hypercorrected the Classical Latin letter \"v\" to a modern \"w\", this is not accepted by the code of nomenclature. Rauvolfia serpentina, commonly known as Indian snakeroot or sarpagandha, contains many indole alkaloids. Rauvolfia serpentina is declining in the wild due to collection for its medicinal uses. Consequently, it is listed in CITES Appendix II. Rauvolfia vomitoria is a highly invasive species in Hawaiʻi, and is capable of establishing dense monotypic stands. As of November 2025, Plants of the World Online accepted these species: formerly included Rauvolfia celastrifolia Baker = Stephanostegia hildebrandtii Baill. Rauvolfia dentata Tafalla ex D.Don = Citharexylum dentatum D.Don Rauvolfia flexuosa Ruiz & Pav. = Citharexylum flexuosum (Ruiz & Pav.) D.Don Rauvolfia glabra Cav. = Vallesia glabra (Cav.)

The plant is native to Mexico, Central America, West Indies, and northern South America. It has been cultivated widely as both an ornamental and for use in traditional medicine. It is now naturalized throughout the tropics including Australasia, Indochina, and India. Rauvolfia tetraphylla fruits are called devil-peppers and hold an important position in the Indian traditional system of medicine. The plant has various significances and it is widely used by South Indian tribes. Asima Chatterjee initiated chemical investigation of alkaloids in Rauvolfia tetraphylla then known as Rauwolfia canescens. Indole alkaloids including serpentine, reserpine, serpentinine, and other Rauwolfia alkaloids were identified in phytochemical study.== References =="

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Reinwardtia.This flower comes from the Himalayas in both China and northern India. A yellow dye made from the flowers is used for dyeing clothes and making paints. Pyoli is the subject of many folk songs. According to Garhwali and Kumaoni folklore, Pyoli was a young maiden living in the forest. She was raised by animals and her first human contact was in the form of a prince who had lost his way during a hunting expedition. She tended after him and of course he fell in love with her. He persuaded her to marry him and accompany him to his palace. Although she loved the prince she started wilting away in the absence of a natural environment. No one could cure her and finally she died pining for her flora and fauna friends. Her last wish was that she should be buried among her friends. The prince took her to be buried at the place he had first met her. Some time later a pretty, yellow flower came out at the spot. This flower was named after the pretty nature-loving belle.

These introductions are often garden escapees; the plant has long been kept as an ornamental plant for its fragrant flowers, the essential oil of which has been used in perfumes. This is an annual herb, producing branching erect stems to 80 centimeters in maximum height. The inflorescence is a spike-like raceme of many flowers. The fragrant flower has six white to yellowish or greenish petals, the upper ones each divided into three narrow, finger-like lobes.

Later on, in the first twenty years of the 14th century, Matteo Silvatico created a garden of simples here, a forerunner of all future botanical gardens in Europe. In this area of extraordinary cultural value, which can now be identified in the area of the Minerva's Garden, he cultivated some of the plants used to produce the active ingredients employed for therapeutic purposes. Matteo Silvatico also taught here, showing the plants to the scholars at the School of Medicine and providing their names and characteristics. During a recent archaeological dig, the mediaeval garden was found at a depth of around two metres under the current ground level. The last owner was Giovanni Capasso who, thanks to the interest of the lawyer Gaetano Nunziante, chairman of the Asilo di Mendicità, donated the whole property to this charitable institution immediately after the Second World War.

The plant is found in the sub-alpine and alpine Himalayas at an altitude of 4000 m.The plant has a 1.5-2m high stem. Its stem is stout, red, and streaked green and brown. The large leaves are heart-shaped or roundish with a heart-shaped base, and greenish-red in colour. The basal leaves can be up to 60 cm wide. It has dark reddish-purple or yellow flowers in late spring to summer, in densely-branched clusters, in a inflorescence up to 30 cm long. The inflorescence enlarges greatly when in fruit. According to the 2003 key in the Flora of China, this species is distinguished from other entire-leaved rhubarbs in China with leaves having a wavy or crisped margin; R. wittrockii, R. rhabarbarum, R. webbianum and R. hotaoense, by having less than 1 cm-sized fruit, purple-red flowers, and the surface of the rachis of panicle being densely pubescent.

It holds cultural significance as a symbolic item on the Haft-sin table during Nowruz, the Persian New Year.Sumacs are dioecious shrubs and small trees that can reach a height of one to ten metres (3–33 ft). The leaves of its type species are pinnately compound, though some species have trifoliate or simple leaves. The flowers are in dense panicles or spikes 5–30 cm (2–12 in) long, each flower very small, greenish, creamy white or red, with five petals. The fruits are reddish, thin-fleshed drupes covered in varying levels of hairs at maturity and form dense clusters at branch tips, sometimes called sumac bobs. Sumacs propagate both by seed (spread by birds and other animals through their droppings), and by new shoots from rhizomes, forming large clonal colonies. The word sumac traces its etymology from Old French sumac (13th century), from Mediaeval Latin sumach, from Arabic سماق summāq, from Syriac ܣܘܡܩܐ summāqa meaning \"red\". The generic name "

Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, East Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant). Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain 40–60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed also contains ricin, a highly potent water-soluble toxin.Ricinus communis can vary greatly in its growth habit and appearance. The variability has been increased by breeders who have selected a range of cultivars for leaf and flower colours, and for oil production. It is a fast-growing, suckering shrub that can reach the size of a small tree, around 12 metres (39 feet), but it is not cold hardy.

The stems are hollow and float in water. The leaf structure is pinnately compound. Small, white, and green inflorescences are produced in clusters and are frequently visited by insects, especially hoverflies, such as Eristalis flies. Watercress is listed in some sources as belonging to the genus Rorippa, although molecular evidence shows those aquatic species with hollow stems are more closely related to Cardamine than Rorippa. Despite the Latin name, watercress is not particularly closely related to the flowers popularly known as nasturtiums (Tropaeolum majus). T. majus belongs to the family Tropaeolaceae, a sister taxon to the Brassicaceae within the order Brassicales. In some regions, watercress is regarded as a weed, in other regions as an aquatic vegetable or herb. Watercress has grown in many temperate locations worldwide.

The rose is named for Dorothea Lady Banks, the wife of botanist Sir Joseph Banks.It is a scrambling shrubby vine growing vigorously to 6 m (20 ft) tall. Unlike most roses, it is practically thornless, though it may bear some prickles up to 5 mm long, particularly on stout, strong shoots. The leaves are evergreen, 4–6 cm long, with three to five (rarely seven) leaflets 2–5 cm long with a serrated margin. The flowers are small, 1.5–2.5 cm diameter, white or pale yellow and are fragrant. It is amongst the earliest flowering of all roses, usually appearing during May in the northern hemisphere, though cold weather can delay flowering. All Lady Banks' roses are said to smell of violets to varying degrees. Rosa banksiae was first described and published by W. T. Aiton in 'Hortus kew.' edition 2, Vol.3 on page 258 in 1811.

The stems are prickly and the leaves are finely-toothed ovals with pointed tips. Rosa moschata found in the western Himalayas is very similar, the main difference being that its branches are smooth and the leaf stalks are without prickles. Several other varieties of wild white roses grow in the hills. Wild, pink roses or Rosa macrophylla are also common and can be seen growing side by side with the white ones. When the wild rose withers away, its place is taken by a red rounded fruit known as a rose-hip. In Hindi, the musk rose is known as Kuji, Kunja or Karer. Sometimes the wood is used to make walking sticks. An attar is extracted from the flowers. A soothing cough syrup is made out of the hips; these have a high vitamin C content. A kind of a marmalade can also be made of the hips by boiling them and passing the pulp through a sieve. == References =="

Other cultivars have appeared as further sports from these roses. Rosa × centifolia 'Muscosa' is a sport with a thick covering of resinous hairs on the flower buds, from which most (but not all) \"moss roses\" are derived. Dwarf or miniature sports have been known for almost as long as the larger forms, including a miniature moss rose 'Moss de Meaux'.

The leaves are 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long, compound, with 5–9 leaflets and feathered stipules. The flowers are produced in large corymbs, each flower small, 1.5–4 cm (5⁄8–1+5⁄8 in) diameter, white or pink, borne in early summer. The hips are reddish to purple, 6–8 mm (15⁄64–5⁄16 in) diameter. Two other varieties have been identified which have many synonyms of their own: Rosa multiflora var. adenochaeta (Koidz.) Ohwi Rosa multiflora var. cathayensis Rehder & E.H.Wilson As well as the type variety Rosa multiflora var. multiflora. Rosa multiflora is grown as an ornamental plant and also used as a rootstock for grafted ornamental rose cultivars. In eastern North America, Rosa multiflora is considered an invasive species.

Most members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), to which it belongs, are tropical, but species of Roscoea grow in much colder mountainous regions. It is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant in gardens.Roscoea purpurea is a perennial herbaceous plant. Like all members of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, \"pseudostems\" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. R. purpurea can grow to over 50 cm tall, with wide leaves and a stout pseudostem, although the height varies. The leaf sheaths are pale green or may have a dark reddish-purple tinge. The stem (peduncle) of the flower spike is hidden by the leaf sheaths. The flowers are the largest of any species in the genus. They are usually purple to mauve in colour, although white- and red-flowered forms have been found in Nepal. Each flower has the typical structure for Roscoea (see the diagrams in that article). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx. Next the three petals (the corolla) form a tube slightly longer than the calyx, terminating in three lobes, an upright hooded central lobe and two slightly smaller side lobes.

It has a number of cultivars, and its leaves are commonly used as a flavoring.Rosemary has a fibrous root system. It forms an aromatic evergreen shrub with leaves similar to Tsuga needles. Forms range from upright to trailing; the upright forms can reach between 1.2–1.8 metres (4–6 ft) tall. The leaves are evergreen, 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) long and 2–5 mm (1⁄16–3⁄16 in) broad, green above, and white below, with dense, short, woolly hair. This plant flowers in spring and summer in temperate climates, but the plants can be in constant bloom in warm climates; flowers are white, pink, purple, or deep blue. The branches are dotted with groups of 2 to 3 flowers down their length. Rosemary also tends to flower outside its normal flowering season; it has been known to flower as late as early December, and as early as mid-February (in the Northern Hemisphere).

It is also cultivated as a culinary herb, and to a lesser extent as an insect repellent and incense.The specific epithet graveolens refers to the strong-smelling leaves. Rue is a woody, perennial shrub. Its leaves are oblong, blue green and arranged bipinnately with rounded leaflets; they release a strong aroma when they are bruised. The flowers are small with 4 to 5 dull yellow petals in cymes. The first flower in each cyme is pentamerous (five sepals, five petals, five stamens and five carpels. All the others are tetramerous (four of each part). They bear brown seed capsules when pollinated.  In the ancient Roman world, the naturalists Pedanius Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder recommended that rue be combined with the poisonous shrub oleander to be drunk as an antidote to venomous snake bites. The refined oil of rue is an emmenagogue and was cited by the Roman historian Pliny the Elder and Soranus as an abortifacient (inducing abortion).

The opposite leaves are strongly reduced to small fleshy scales with a narrow dry margin, hairless, unstalked and united at the base, thus enclosing and forming a succulent sheath around the stem, which gives it the appearance of being composed of jointed segments.

It grows rapidly, but has a short lifespan, between 40 and 75 years. The shoots are Yellowish-brown, with small buds. The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged, narrow, light green, 4–16 cm (1.6–6.3 in) long and 0.5–2 cm (0.2–0.8 in) broad, with finely serrate margins and long acuminate tips; they turn a gold-yellow in autumn. The flowers are arranged in catkins produced early in the spring; it is dioecious, with the male and female catkins on separate trees. Salix babylonica was described and named scientifically by Carl Linnaeus in 1736, who knew the species as the pendulous-branched (\"weeping\") variant then recently introduced into the Clifford garden in Hartekamp in The Netherlands. Early Chinese cultivar selections include the original weeping willow, Salix babylonica 'Pendula', in which the branches and twigs are strongly pendulous, which was presumably spread along ancient trade routes.

The grey or reddish stems are up to 2 cm (0.8 in) thick and these and the lower leaves are densely hairy. In the upper parts of the plant the stems are creamy or pale grey and branch frequently, some branches growing vertically while others spread horizontally. Regularly-arranged, catkin-like branchlets project from the branches. The leaves are tiny, succulent and linear or narrowly triangular. The inflorescence is spike-like with bracts similar to the leaves, small flowers with five petals, five stamens and two styles. The fruiting perianth has silky wings. The species was first described in 1775 as Salsola imbricata by the Swedish naturalist Peter Forsskål. In 1849, Alfred Moquin-Tandon transferred it to the genus Caroxylon, making it Caroxylon imbricatum (Forssk.) Moq., but later it was mostly accepted in genus Salsola. Following a phylogenetic analysis of Salsoloideae in 2007 by Akhani, H., et al., it has been proposed to place Salsola imbricata back into Caroxylon imbricatum.

It is native to Macaronesia, and from the Atlantic coasts of Europe to the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean (although it has been introduced elsewhere). It is an annual plant which grows primarily in the temperate biome, in salty sandy coastal soils. It is commonly known as prickly saltwort or prickly glasswort. In dry inland places it is replaced by Salsola tragus (syn. Kali tragus or Salsola kali subsp. tragus), which is less tolerant to salty soils, and has spread more widely from Eurasia to other continents. Salsola kali is less widespread as an introduced species in America.The species was first described in 1753 as Salsola kali by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum. Until 2007, it belonged to genus Salsola (sensu lato), but after molecular genetical research, it was proposed that the genus be split, and the species placed into the genus Kali Mill. (syn. Salsola sect. Kali Dum.). In the genus Kali, the valid name is Kali turgidum (Dumort.) Guterm. (incorrectly as \"turgida\", basionym: Salsola turgida Dumort.). The name Kali soda Moench used by Akhani et al. (2007) is invalid because of the older name Kali soda Scop. (a synonym of Salsola soda). As of March 2024, Plants of the World Online subsumed all Kali species into Salsola. Salsola kali belongs to tribe Salsoleae s. str. Salsola kali and other closely related species form a speci"

The root and stem possess various antimicrobial agents and is traditionally used as toothbrush in Pakistan and India.The vann is commonly found in and around Sandal Bar, and is reserved for use as grazing sources for local peasant villages. In addition, a number of trees have been preserved to provide shade for cattle. The vann is mostly non-woody and the small amount of wood that it has is soft, light, and not particularly useful for any of wood's normal uses, notably building and heat. When burnt, it leaves a large quantity of ash, which can then be boiled down into a substance for treating mange in camels.

Its bark is scabrous and cracked, whitish with pendulous extremities. The root bark of the tree is similar in colour to sand, and the inner surfaces are an even lighter shade of brown. It has a pleasant fragrance, of cress or mustard, as well as a warm and pungent taste. The tree produces small red edible fruits, juicy but pungent, in clusters, and its dark green leaves are round and fleshy. The genus was named by the French botanist, Laurent Garcin, in 1749 after a Spanish apothecary, Juan Salvador y Bosca. The type specimen was collected in Persia, giving the species name persica. Salvadora persica is commonly known as toothbrush tree or mustard tree, and has various other names in different languages, such as arak and jhal.

It was one of the plants exploited by Austronesian arboriculture and it was introduced by Austronesian sailors to East Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia during the ancient spice trade, becoming naturalized in South India by at least 1300 BCE. It was greatly valued for its fragrance, and is considered sacred in some religions like Hinduism. The high value of the species has caused over-exploitation, to the point where the wild population is vulnerable to extinction. Indian sandalwood still commands high prices for its essential oil owing to its high alpha-santalol content, but the lack of sizable trees has essentially eliminated its former use for fine woodworking. The plant is long-lived, but harvest is only viable after many years.Santalum album is an evergreen tree that grows between 4–9 metres (13–30 feet).

It is a deciduous tree that grows in the lower foothills and midhills of the Himalayas at altitudes of up to 1,200 metres (4,000 ft). It is also native to western coastal Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in India; as well as Nepal Indochina, southern China, Japan and Taiwan as known by its many indigenous peoples. It is tolerant to reasonably poor soil, can be planted around farmers' homes, and one tree can produce 30 to 35 kilograms (66 to 77 lb) of fruit per year. The soapnut contains saponin, which has soap-like properties. The fruit can be used in an enhanced oil recovery technique, yielding a surfactant for washing arsenic from soils containing iron. Due to its saponin content, the extract exhibits antibacterial activity in vitro. Media related to Sapindus mukorossi at Wikimedia Commons"

The fatty coat of the seeds, used for candle and soap making, is known as stillingia tallow; hence its common name. It is relevant to biodiesel production because it is the third most productive vegetable oil producing crop in the world, after algae and oil palm. The leaves are used as herbal medicine to treat boils. The plant sap and leaves are reputed to be toxic, and decaying leaves from the plant are toxic to other species of plants. The species is classified as a noxious invader in the southern U.S. This species and T. cochinchinensis were formerly classified in the genus Stillingia, as Stillingia sebifera and Stillingia discolor (hence the name still used for the oil and tallow). The specific epithet sebifera is derived from Latin sebum (meaning \"tallow\") and fero (meaning \"to bear\"), thus \"tallow-bearing\". At some time before 1950, this tree was reclassified into the genus Sapium as Sapium sebiferum, and many papers about the oil still refer to the tree by this name.

The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by insects. Flowers bloom in mid-monsoon (July–August) amongst the rocks and grasses of the hillside at an altitudinal range of 3700–4600 m. Flower heads are purple, hidden from view in layers of yellowish-green papery bracts, which provide protection from the cold mountain environment. The flowers can be seen from July through September, after which the above-ground portions of the plant die back, becoming visible again in April. The Saussurea genus are named for alpine scientist Horace Bénédict de Saussure, while the specific epithet obvallata is derived from obvallatus, meaning \"surrounded by wall;\" in this case the flower's involucriform bracts. A postal stamp featuring the image of the flower and labeled Sassurea obvallata in binomial nomenclature and Brahma Kamal in the Devanagari script was issued by the Indian government in 1982. Sometime after the new state of Uttarakhand was created in 2007 (changing its name from Uttaranchal, created in 2000), the flower was declared the state flower.

The branchlets are 1–1.5 cm thick with white tufts at the leaf axils. Leaves are slightly succulent about 8–25 cm cm long, closely alternate or in a spiral and crowded at the stem tips. They are glabrous with a fleshy-looking yellowish green color. It flowers every time of the year in fan-like clusters which gives them the name fanflower or half flower. Each flower has white petals between 2–2.5 cm long, sometimes with violet stripes. Each flower has a curved style. They are pollinated by large bees or on its own. The fruit is a round, fleshy drupe between 1–15 mm. It is similar to the fruit of S. plumieri – both were included in the original circumscription of the species.

In Thailand, this species is considered a rare plant, endemic to only a few places, such as Phu Wiang National Park, Khao Kradong Forest Park, etc. It is known as yoni pisaj (Thai: โยนีปีศาจ, \"devil's vagina\") or hee phi (หีผี, \"ghost's pussy\"), because the ripe fruit looks like female genitalia. There is a local legend that says that, Maiden Orapim, followed the man she loved, Prince Panjit, the son of Khmer King. The two were separated by a large, fast-flowing river. Orapim was afraid that crossing the river would be inconvenient because she was a woman, so she prayed to place her breasts on the wild cotton tree (Bombax ceiba) and her genital on weaver's beam tree, and so she transformed into a man and continued to search for Prince Panjit. == References "

It is a perennial plant that grows rapidly with long rhizomes that end in small tubers. A. grossus is considered a \"principal\" weed of rice in some Southeast Asian countries. It is abundant in swampy or inundated areas, such as marshes and ditches, and is capable of dominating wetlands and rice patties. It is also a host of Chilo polychrysus, the dark-headed rice borer.Stands of greater club rush grow to lengths of 1.5 to 2 meters. It grows well in both inundated lands and areas with flooding. Individuals grow in colonies with 10 to 15 centimeters between stems. The tight spacing of stems reduces the speed of flooding and helps filter trash or debris floating in waterways. The tubers of A. grossus are used in folk medicine as a treatment for liver disease, although experimental evidence to support this is limited. Ganapathi et al. (2018) showed a protective effect of ethanolic extract of the A. grossus tubers when treating ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity in rats; treatment of the extract significantly restored the liver enzymes, reduced lipid peroxidation, and restored altered catalase and glutathione "

Most of the leaves of S. lacustris are reduced to bladeless sheaths around the stem, but leaf blades up to 100 cm (40 in) long can be formed under water. The inflorescence appears at the top of the stem, and comprises 3–10 branches, each of which is up to 10 cm (4 in) long and may be again divided into shorter branches. The flowers are in the form of spikelets, each of which is 6–15 mm (0.2–0.6 in) long by 3–5 millimetres (0.1–0.2 in) wide. It typically grows in water 0.3–⁠1.5 m deep, but can grow in water deeper than this.

B. maritimus often dominates in areas with saline, muddy substrates that are rich in minerals with substantial water level fluctuations that typically flood in spring and early summer. However these habitats have grown in economic importance and are used intensively for livestock grazing, which has led to the disappearance of B. maritimus from its historical range, exacerbated by land reclamation, invasive species, and conversion to arable land.

The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as Sedum are now in the segregate genera Hylotelephium and Rhodiola. Well-known European species of Sedum are Sedum acre, Sedum album, Sedum dasyphyllum, and Sedum hispanicum.Sedum is a genus that includes annual, biennial, and perennial herbs. They are characterised by succulent leaves and stems. The extent of morphological diversity and homoplasy make it impossible to characterise Sedum phenotypicaly. Sedum was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, with 15 species. Of the genera encompassed by the Crassulaceae family, Sedum is the most species rich, the most morphologically diverse and most complex taxonomically.

The specific epithet anacardium (\"up-heart\") was used by apothecaries in the 16th century to refer to the plant's fruit. It was later used by Linnaeus to refer to the cashew. It is a deciduous tree. Like the closely related cashew, the fruit is composed of two parts, a reddish-orange accessory fruit and a black drupe that grows at the end. The nut is about 25 millimetres (1 in) long, ovoid and smooth lustrous black. The accessory fruit is edible and sweet when ripe, but the black fruit is toxic and produces a severe allergic reaction if it is consumed or its resin comes in contact with the skin. The seed inside the black fruit, known as godambi (गोडंबी), is edible when properly prepared.

These bees were traditionally held to be a very ancient lineage, but as has more recently turn out their primitive traits are simply retained from ancestral bees. As of 2012 there were about 470 described species, and an estimated total around 700. They occur throughout the world except in Antarctica, Australia, Madagascar, and Southeast Asia. There are about 60 species in Europe and about 100 in North America north of Mexico. Due to their breeding habits, they require soils that are somewhat sandy and not too humid; the bulk of their diversity is found in temperate to subtropical Asia, in particular Central Asia. Since their relatives are found mainly in the Americas and Australia, the high diversity of Colletes in Asia is probably secondary and fairly recent, with the genus most likely originating in tropical America perhaps as much as 50 million years ago, and diversifying abundantly in the highly continental climate they found in interior Eurasia.Most Colletes species are somewhat similar to a diminutive honey bee.

Instead, many PA-containing plants were traditionally used for medicinal purposes in various cultures around the world. For example, herbs containing PAs were used in traditional Chinese medicine and by Native American tribes for their purported therapeutic properties. It has been estimated that 3% of the world's flowering plants contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Honey can contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, as can grains, milk, offal and eggs. To date (2011), there is no international regulation of PAs in food, unlike those for herbs and medicines. In the early to mid-20th century, researchers began to observe and document cases of livestock poisoning linked to the consumption of PA-containing plants. These observations led to the recognition of PAs as potent hepatotoxic and genotoxic compounds.

These alkaloids serve as a natural biocides to deter or even kill animals that would eat them. Livestock generally do not find them palatable. Senecio species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species that have developed tolerance for these alkaloids. The traditional circumscription of Senecio is artificial, being polyphyletic, even in its new circumscription which is based on genetic data. Despite the separation of many species into other genera, the genus still contains c. 1,250 species and is one of the largest genera of flowering plants. As no morphological synapomorphies are known to determine which species belong to the genus or not, no exact species number is known. The genus has an almost worldwide distribution and evolved in the mid- to late"

S. vulgaris is very similar to Senecio viscosus, but S. vulgaris does not have the glandular hairs and ray florets found in S. viscosus. Upper leaves of S. vulgaris are sessile, lacking their own stem (petiole), alternating in direction along the length of the plant, two rounded lobes are at the base of the stem (auriculate) and subclasping above. The leaves are pinnately lobed and about 2.4 inches (61 mm) long and 1 inch (25 mm) wide, smaller towards the top of the plant. They are sparsely covered with soft, smooth, fine hairs. The leaf lobes typically are sharp to rounded saw-toothed. The hollow stems branch at the tops and from the base. Stems and leaves can both host the Cineraria leaf rust.

It sends out fibrous, pithy stems with long leaves and bears purple-spotted yellow flowers. It produces pods which contain light brown beans. It is native to Asia and North Africa, is most common in tropical Africa where it grows as a common noxious weed, and has been introduced to the Americas. It can grow on saline soil. S. bispinosa is adapted to wet, heavy soil but apparently adapts easily to drought-prone or sandy regions. It is cultivated widely in India and it is grown in rice paddies in Vietnam for use as firewood. The plant has a great number of uses, including as green manure, rice straw, wood and fodder. It can be used like industrial hemp for rope, fish nets, sackcloth and sailcloth. Its fibers are similar to those of birch trees and show promise as a source of paper fiber. The foliage makes a good fodder for livestock and the beans can be fed to fowl. The plant has been also used as a famine food by people. Natural gum from the plant is useful as a thickening "

The leaf blades are usually unlobed with serrated edges, but may be divided into lobes. They are borne on petioles and have stipules. Flowers are solitary or arranged in inflorescences of various forms. Each has five hairy sepals and five petals in shades of yellow, orange, or white. There are many stamens and a style divided into several branches. The fruit is a disc-shaped schizocarp up to 2 cm (3/4 inch) wide which is divided into five to 12 sections, each containing one seed. The pollens are spherical in shape. Many Sida are attractive to butterflies and moths. Arrowleaf sida (Sida rhombifolia), for example, is a larval host for the tropical checkered skipper (Pyrgus oileus). The Sida golden mosaic virus and Sida golden yellow vein virus have been first isolated from Sida species; the former specifically from Sida santaremensis.

The fruit of the species is coined by its common name, “ear-drops” due to its appearance of hanging earrings. The stems shows proximal portions to be woody and the distal portions of the shoots to be herbaceous. Hence the species is regarded as a semi-woody vine. The optimum temperature found for germination of the species is 35 °C in both soil and Petri dishes. Below or above, 25 °C and 40 °C, respectively will yield no germination or emergence. Furthermore it requires altitude ranges of 0 to 200 meters and can grow up to 40 feet tall. Brunnichia ovata is a native vine to North America. It is native to coastal plains of the south-central and southeastern United States, ranging from Texas to Alabama, as far north as southern Illinois, and eastward to Georgia. Plants grow near riverbanks, the perimeters of lakes, wet woods and thickets. Redvine is a"

Synonyms include Malva rhombifolia. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine, where it is known as kurumthotti.The stems are erect to sprawling and branched, growing 50 to 120 centimeters in height, with the lower sections being woody. The dark green, diamond-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, 4 to 8 centimeters long, with petioles that are less than a third of the length of the leaves. The leaves are paler below, with short, grayish hairs. The apical half of the leaves have toothed or serrated margins while the remainder of the leaves are smooth. The petioles have small spiny stipules at their bases. The moderately delicate flowers occur singly on flower stalks that arise from the area between the stems and leaf petioles. They consist of five petals that are 4 to 8 millimeters long, creamy to orange-yellow in color, and may be somewhat reddish in the center. Each of the five overlapping petals is asymmetric, having a long lobe on one side. The stamens unite in a short column. The fruit is a ribbed capsule, which breaks up into 8 to 10 segments.

    "knowledge_text": "Solanum is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants, which include three food crops of high economic importance: the potato, the tomato and the eggplant (aubergine, brinjal). It is the largest genus in the nightshade family Solanaceae, comprising around 1,500 species. It also contains the so-called horse nettles (unrelated to the genus of true nettles, Urtica), as well as numerous plants cultivated for their ornamental flowers and fruit. Solanum species show a wide range of growth habits, such as annuals and perennials, vines, subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees. Many formerly independent genera like Lycopersicon (the tomatoes) and Cyphomandra are now included in Solanum as subgenera or sections. Thus, the genus today contains roughly 1,500–2,000 species.The generic name was first used by Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79) for a plant also known as strychnos, most likely S. nigrum. Its derivation is uncertain, possibly stemming from the Latin word sol, meaning \"sun\", referring to its status as a plant of the sun. The species most commonly called nightshade in North America and Britain is Solanum dulcamara, also called bittersweet or woody nightshade (so-called because it is a scandent shrub). Its foliage and egg-shaped red berries are poisonous, the active principle being solanine, which can cause convulsions and death if taken in large doses. Black nightshades (many species in the Solanum nigrum complex, Solanum sect. Solanum) have varying levels of toxins and are considered too"

It is native to Europe and Asia, and widely naturalised elsewhere, including North America.It occurs in a very wide range of habitats, from woodlands to scrubland, hedges and marshes. Solanum dulcamara is a semi-woody herbaceous perennial vine, which scrambles over other plants, capable of reaching a height of 4 m where suitable support is available, but more often 1–2 m high. The leaves are 4–12 cm long, roughly arrowhead-shaped, and often lobed at the base. The flowers are in loose clusters of 3–20, 1–1.5 cm across, star-shaped, with five purple petals and yellow stamens and style pointing forward. The fruit is an ovoid red berry about 1 cm long, soft and juicy, with the aspect and odour of a tiny tomato, and edible for some birds, which disperse the seeds widely. However, the berry is poisonous to humans and livestock, and the berry's attractive and familiar look makes it dangerous for children.

Its flowers are white and its fruits are pale yellow. S. lasiocarpum is found wild in parts of temperate and tropical Asia: the Andaman Islands, Sri Lanka, Indochina, south China, Taiwan, much of Malesia, Papuasia and Queensland, Australia. In other countries it is primarily known as a domesticated plant. Domesticated plants bear larger fruits and lack the prickly skin that is found in the wild plants. The color found in the center of fruit is light green, like that of Solanum quitoense. It's cultivated in tropical Asia, used in food additives for flavoring, and given to the sick as a folk medicine. In India, the locals use the fruit as a sour-relish in curries. In Thailand, a special kind of sauce called nam prek is made with the fruit. In Tonga, where the fruit known as the touloku was used similarly to the tomato and as such was displaced when the introduced latter became more popular. Solanum lasiocarpum is of interest to botanists because of its strong resemblance to, and apparent close relation to South American species, the cocona (S. sessiliflorum), the naranjilla (S. quitoense), and the pseudolulo (S. pseudolulo) in particular.

Solanum melongena is grown worldwide for its edible fruit, typically used as a vegetable in cooking. Most commonly purple, the spongy, absorbent fruit is used in several cuisines. It is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato, chili pepper, and potato, although those are of the Americas region while the eggplant is of the Eurasia region. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be eaten, but it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in the culinary arts. It was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade species thorn or bitter apple, S. incanum, probably with two independent domestications: one in South Asia, and one in East Asia. In 2023, world production of eggplants was 61 million tonnes (130 billion pounds), with China and India combining for 85% of the total.The eggplant is a delicate, tropical perennial plant often cultivated as a tender or half-hardy annual in temperate climates.

Some other species may also be referred to as \"black nightshade\".

The plant was known and mentioned by ancient herbalists, including Dioscorides. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus described six varieties of Solanum nigrum in Species Plantarum.Black nightshade is a common herb or short-lived perennial shrub, found in many wooded areas, as well as disturbed habitats.

Potatoes are underground stem tubers of the plant Solanum tuberosum, a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. Genetic studies show that the cultivated potato has a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000–10,000 years ago from a species in the S. brevicaule complex. Many varieties of the potato are cultivated in the Andes region of South America, where the species is indigenous. The Spanish introduced potatoes to Europe in the second half of the 16th century from the Americas. They are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. Following centuries of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different varieties of potatoes. The potato remains an essential crop in Europe, especially Northern and Eastern Europe, where per capita production is still the highest in the world, while the most rapid expansion in production during the 21st century was in southern and eastern Asia, with China and India leading the world production as of 2023.

The leaves are bluish-green, simple, lanceolate, with wavy and sometimes lobed margins, covered in spines on both the margins and beneath. The base of the leaf surrounds the stem. The leaves and stems emit a milky sap when cut. One plant will produce several flat-topped arrays of flower heads, each head containing numerous yellow ray flowers but no disc flowers. Sonchus asper is native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It has also become naturalized on other continents and is regarded as a noxious, invasive weed in many places. Its edible leaves make a palatable and nutritious leaf vegetable. It is found in cultivated soil, pastures, roadsides, edges of yards, vacant lots, construction sites, waste areas and in grasslands.

It prefers full sun, and can tolerate most soil conditions. The flowers are hermaphroditic, and common pollinators include bees and flies. It spreads by seeds being carried by wind or water. Its specific epithet oleraceus means \"vegetable/herbal\". The common name 'sow thistle' refers to its attractiveness to pigs, and the similarity of the leaf to younger thistle plants. The common name 'hare's thistle' refers to its purported beneficial effects on hare and rabbits. Annual sowthistle is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth, prolific seed production, and wide dispersal. The plant thrives in disturbed environments, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, spreading aggressively through wind-dispersed seeds. It forms dense populations that outcompete native vegetation by quickly establishing in open areas, particularly after soil disturbance. Sowthistle's resilience to various soil types and its ability to reseed itself make it difficult to control in many regions. In Australia it is a common and widespread "

It typically grows 4 to 10 feet tall and is often found in coastal conditions and near wetlands. The name Necklacepod is derived from the characteristic string of seed pods that develop after its yellow flowers germinate into seeds. Necklacepod is a nectar plant for bees, butterflies, and in parts of the Americas hummingbirds as well. It is suggested for use by native plant enthusiasts in Florida as a good landscape plant for xeriscaping but it only naturally occurs in coastal counties in the central and southern part of the state, while closely related varieties occur in Texas, and the Caribbean. The variety of Necklacepod growing in Australia is considered an endangered species in some areas due to the clearing of coastal habitat and displacement by invasive species. In Sri Lanka, the plant is known as moodu murunga. The inedible pod has some similarities to the murunga (drumstick) pod. It has been used to make fish poisons, insect and spider repellents, especially in Africa.

A recent definition includes trees native to most of Europe and parts of Asia, as well as northern Africa. The range extends from Madeira, the British Isles and Iceland to Russia and northern China. Unlike many plants with similar distributions, it is not native to Japan. The plant is frost hardy and colonizes disrupted and inaccessible places as a short-lived pioneer species.

Johnson grass has been used for forage and to stop erosion, but it is often considered a weed because: Foliage that becomes wilted from frost or hot, dry weather can contain sufficient amounts of hydrogen cyanide to kill cattle and horses if it is eaten in quantity. The foliage can cause 'bloat' in such herbivores from the accumulation of excessive nitrates; otherwise, it is edible. It grows and spreads rapidly, it can 'choke out' other cash crops planted by farmers. This species occurs in crop fields, pastures, abandoned fields, rights-of-way, forest edges, and along streambanks. It thrives in open, disturbed, rich, bottom ground, particularly in cultivated fields. Johnson grass that is resistant to the common herbicide glyphosate has been found in Argentina and the United States. It is considered to be one of the ten worst weeds in the world. In the United States, Johnson grass is listed as either a noxious or quarantined weed in 19 states.

It is native to the Americas and has been introduced to Asia, Africa, the Pacific islands, and Australia. One familiar species is Acmella oleracea, which has been widely cultivated for centuries. It is used for food and medicine, and as an insecticide and an ornamental plant. Its common use as an herbal remedy for toothache and oral infections earned it the nickname toothache plant. These are annual or perennial herbs with branching stems usually reaching 10 to 20 centimeters in length, growing prostrate or erect. The oppositely arranged leaves are smooth-edged or toothed, and usually have rough or soft hairs. The flower heads are usually solitary at the tips of the stem branches, or occasionally borne in inflorescences. There are several to many disc florets with bell-shaped throats and 4 or 5 triangular lobes, usually yellow, or sometimes orange. Some species lack ray florets, but some have 5 to 20 or more, usually in yellow or orange, but occasionally white or purple. The disc florets are bisexual, but any ray florets are pistillate.Accepted species  Media related to Acmella at Wikimedia Commons GRIN Species Records of Acmella.

It is of the order Caryophyllales, family Amaranthaceae, subfamily Chenopodioideae. Its leaves are a common vegetable consumed either fresh, cooked or after storage (using preservation techniques like canning, freezing, or dehydration). The taste differs considerably between cooked and raw: the high oxalate content may be reduced by steaming. It is an annual plant (rarely biennial), growing as tall as 30 cm (1 ft). Spinach may overwinter in temperate regions. The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular, and very variable in size: 2–30 cm (1–12 in) long and 1–15 cm (1⁄2–6 in) broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem. The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3–4 mm (1⁄8–5⁄32 in) in diameter, and mature into a small, hard, dry, lumpy fruit cluster 5–10 mm (1⁄4–3⁄8 in) across containing several seeds. In 2022, world production of spinach was 33 million tonnes, with China alone accounting for 93% of the total.The English word \"spinach\" dates to the late 14th century from the Old French word espinache. The name entered European languages from medieval Latin spinagium, borrowed from Andalusian Arabic, isbinakh, that in turn derives from Persian aspānāḵ.

Each flower is around 6 mm (0.24 in) in diameter, with 10 stamens, 3 stigmas, five lanceolate–triangular, green-coloured but scarious-margined sepals, and five slightly shorter white petals. The petals are divided into two almost to their base with the two halves angled apart, so that the two halves of each petal lie over parts of adjacent sepals. Bog stitchwort grows in various types of wetland habitat; in the British Isles, it is especially characteristic of areas poached by cattle. It flowers in spring and early summer. Bog stitchwort is widespread in central and western Europe, but is rarer in eastern and southern Europe and the northern half of Scandinavia. It is thought to be native to eastern parts of North America, but to be an introduced species in the Pacific Northwest.

It is also sold as a dietary supplement. In 1940, a Vietnamese scientist Sang Dinh Bui extracted an alkaloid from the root of Stephania rotunda with the yield of 1.2–1.5% and he named this compound rotundin. From 1950 to 1952, two Indian scientists studied and extracted from Stephania glabra another alkaloid named hyndanrine.

Asiatic witchweed is a serious agricultural pest, as it parasitises important crop species, including corn, rice, sorghum, and sugar cane, often causing substantial yield reductions. While it is native to Africa and Asia, it is invasive in farmlands of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. In the US, this witchweed was discovered in the Carolinas in 1956. It is considered an invasive agricultural pest, and a vigorous eradication campaign has reduced the affected area by 99% [from 450,000 acres (1,820 km2) to about 3,400 acres (1,400 ha)]. Biological control can be achieved by growing a Desmodium (tick-trefoil) undercrop (see push–pull technology). The trefoil can be used as green manure or animal fodder after the harvest.S. asiatica seedlings are not visible above ground, but white succulent shoots can be found attached to host roots. Mature plants have green foliage above ground, sparsely covered with coarse, short, white, bulbous-based hairs. Mature plants are normally 15–30 centimetres (5.9–11.8 in) tall, but have grown to 60 centimetres (24 in).

It is currently classified in the family Orobanchaceae, although older classifications place it in the Scrophulariaceae. Some species are serious pathogens of cereal crops, with the greatest effects being in savanna agriculture in Africa. It also causes considerable crop losses in other regions, including other tropical and subtropical crops in its native range and in the Americas. The generic name derives from Latin strī̆ga, \"witch\". Witchweeds are characterized by bright-green stems and leaves and small, brightly colored and attractive flowers. They are obligate hemiparasites of roots and require a living host for germination and initial development, though they can then survive on their own. The number of species is uncertain, but may exceed 40 by some counts.Although most species of Striga are not pathogens that affect agriculture, some species have devastating effects upon crops, particularly those planted by subsistence farmers. Crops most commonly affected are maize, sorghum, rice and sugarcane. Three species cause the most damage: Striga asiatica, S. gesnerioides, and S. hermonthica. Witchweed parasitizes maize, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, rice, legumes, and a range of weedy grasses. It is capable of significantly reducing yields, in some cases wiping out the entire crop.

In the state of Maharashtra, in the Marathi language, and other local dialects and in the neighboring state of Karnataka, the shrub is locally known as karvi (कारवी), sometimes spelled in English as karvy. This shrub belongs to the genus Strobilanthes which was first scientifically described by Nees in the 19th century. The genus has around 350 species, of which at least 46 are found in India. Because most of these species show an unusual flowering behaviour, varying from annual to 16-year blooming cycles, there is often confusion on the national scale about which plant is flowering.It is a large shrub, sometimes attaining 6–20 ft in height and 21⁄2 inches in diameter and flowers between July and September. This plant is recognized for the fact that it takes nearly a decade for the bloom cycle to occur. Its leaves are home to several insects including caterpillars and snails which feed on it. The shrub has an interesting life cycle; It comes alive and green every year with the advent of monsoon, but once the rainy season is over, all that is left is dry and dead-looking stems.

It is native primarily to tropical Africa, extending to South Africa, with a few species in Asia from southern India to New Guinea and southern China. The genus name is a compound of the Greek words στρόφος (stróphos) \"twisted cord\" and ἄνθος (ánthos) \"flower\", in reference to the corolla lobes which, in some species - notably S. petersianus (see below) - resemble long twisted ribbons or threads and can reach a length of 30–35 cm. This trait, in addition to colouring involving combinations of bright pinks, purples and oranges, combine to make the flowers among the most ornamental in the plant kingdom. The genus includes vines, shrubs, and small trees. The leaves are opposite or whorled, simple broad lanceolate, 2–20 cm long, with an entire margin. Several African tribes used Strophanthus as the principal ingredient in arrow poison. After dipping the arrows of their hunting weapons into a strong concentration of the ingredient, the effect was to stun their prey. Plants from this genus produce toxic alkaloids and cardiac glycosides g-strophanthin (syn. ouabain), k-strophanthin, and e-strophanthin. As ordinarily administered, the drug acts on the heart before influencing any other organ or tissue. Indeed, often no other effect may be observed.

Styrax benzoin can live 70–100 years. It is unknown how it came to Sumatra. Scientists says styrax benzoin from Sumatra has the best quality. The process of tapping and harvesting frankincense takes one year. The styrax benzoin tree trunk is cut slightly, so that the white styrax sap will appear from the skin. After 4–6 months of the styrax sap hardens on the tree trunks at which point the sap can be harvested. The sap that has been harvested is not clean and is dried for 3 to 6 months to remove impurities. After the sap has dried, it is ready for export. Incense trees grow in several countries in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia. The tree can thrive in mountainous areas and cold temperatures with high rainfall. Styrax trees can also grow in lowland areas with hot temperatures but these do not produce good quality styrax sap. Styrax benzoin is cultivated as a main source of benzoin resin in Indonesia. It is also grown as an ornamental tree for shade in West Africa. Styrax — 'Uses of resin' section == References =="

It is usually a rounded, much-branched bush but can be prostrate, climbing or straggling. It is densely-branched, the stems feeling very rough when the leaves are shed, pale green at first, becoming grey and fissured. The leaves are succulent, the smaller ones being long and narrow while the larger ones are elliptical. The flowers grow in clusters in the leaf axils. Some are bisexual, being drum-shaped and up to 1.5 mm (0.06 in) wide, with five succulent tepals fused to a third of their length. Others are entirely female, rather smaller with non-succulent tepals, fused for half their length, persistent and partly concealing the fruit. There are three stigmas. The perianth enlarges in the bisexual fruits but remains unchanged in the female fruits. Reproduction is mainly by seed, which are black and shining, slightly flattened, globular or drop-shaped.

It is native to all of eastern Asia and was introduced to the United States in around 1871. It is a tree reaching 12 m (39 ft) in favorable conditions, though it is often more shrub-like, and is used as an ornamental due to its visually striking blue fruit from which it derives its common name.The intensely blue fruit of the tree are relatively short-lived, as the fleshy berries are quickly eaten by birds. The foliage of the tree is neat and the flowers are often fragrant. The leaves have short petioles and vary in their ovoid shape, measuring up to 3.5 in (9 cm) in length and half as wide. The leaves bear some trichomes above and are far more pubescent on their veins beneath. The species blooms in early summer after leaves have developed. These whitish blooms are formed in lateral clusters up to 2 in (5 cm) long, with each hermaphroditic flower bearing five petals and thirty stamens, the latter of which give the flower clusters a fluffy appearance. The ovoid fruits of the tree most often bear a single seed. Symplocos coreana is a very similar species, possibly conspecific, only differing in its broader and coarsely serrated leaves that bear many hairs on both sides. The fruit can be made into jam, although it may be difficult to obtain enough berries since the plants do not pollinate themselves.

The clove tree is an evergreen that grows up to 8–12 metres (26–39 ft) tall, with large leaves and crimson flowers grouped in terminal clusters. The flower buds initially have a pale hue, gradually turn green, then transition to a bright red when ready for harvest. Cloves are harvested at 1.5–2 centimetres (5⁄8–3⁄4 in) long, and consist of a long calyx that terminates in four spreading sepals, and four unopened petals that form a small central ball.

A rapidly growing plant, it is considered an invasive species in many world regions. Syzygium cumini has been introduced to areas including islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. The tree was introduced to Florida and is grown in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Its fruits are eaten by various native birds and small mammals, such as jackals, civets, and fruit bats.Its dense foliage provides shade and is grown for its ornamental value. At the base of the tree, the bark is rough and dark grey, becoming lighter grey and smoother higher up. The wood is water resistant after being kiln-dried. Because of this, it is used in railway sleepers and to install motors in wells. It is sometimes used to make cheap furniture and village dwellings, though it is relatively hard for carpentry. The aromatic leaves are pinkish when young, changing to a leathery, glossy dark green with a yellow midrib as they mature.

It is native to tropical and subtropical rainforests in hilly regions of South Asia, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indochina, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and eastern China.It grows in the understorey of humid primary and secondary rainforests. The substrates it grows in are rocky soil and sandy soil underneath leaf litter. Tacca integrifolia is a herb growing from a thick, cylindrical rhizome as long as 12 cm (5 in) and a diameter of 3 cm (1 in). Its oblong-elliptical or lanceolate leaf blades are borne on long stems, some 50 by 20 cm (20 by 8 in) including the petioles, with tapering bases and slender pointed tips. White batflowers that grow in hilly areas are larger in size than batflowers that grow elsewhere.

This plant reaches heights of between 20 and 90 cm (7.9 and 35.4 in). The Aztecs gathered the wild plant as well as cultivating it for medicinal, ceremonial and decorative purposes; it was introduced to Europe after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and colonization and became widely cultivated commercially with many cultivars in use as ornamental plants, and for the cut-flower trade. Some authorities regard Tagetes patula (the French marigold) as a synonym of Tagetes erecta.The Spanish name cempazúchitl (or cempasúchil) comes from the Nahuatl cempohualxochitl (\"twenty flower\") – 20 (cempohualli) is the base of the Aztec vigesimal counting system, consequently a symbol of completion including in life reflected in measurements like their calendrical daycount.

The tamarind tree produces brown, pod-like fruits that contain a sweet, tangy pulp, which is used in cuisines around the world. The pulp is also used in traditional medicine and as a dye. The wood can be used for woodworking, and tamarind seed oil can be extracted from the seeds. Its young leaves are used in Indian and Filipino cuisine. Because tamarind has multiple uses, it is cultivated worldwide in tropical and subtropical zones.The tamarind is a long-living, medium-growth tree, which attains a maximum crown height of 25–30 metres (82–98 feet). The crown has an irregular, vase-shaped outline of dense foliage up to 12 m (39 ft) wide. A tamarind trunk may grow to a circumference of 7.5 m (25 ft). The tree grows well in full sun. It prefers clay, loam, sandy, and acidic soil types, with a high resistance to drought and wind-borne salt as found in coastal areas. The evergreen leaves are alternately arranged and paripinnately compound. The leaflets are bright green, elliptic-ovular, pinnately veined, and less than 15 centimetres (6 inches) in length. The branches droop from a single, central trunk as the tree matures, and are often pruned in agriculture to optimize tree density and ease"

The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus has a near-cosmopolitan distribution, absent only from tropical and polar areas. Two of the most common species worldwide, T. officinale (the common dandelion) and T. erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), are European species introduced into North America, where they are non-native. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats. Like other members of the family Asteraceae, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. In part due to their abundance, along with being a generalist species, dandelions are one of the most vital early spring nectar sources for a wide host of pollinators. Many Taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.The Latin name Taraxacum derives from the Arabic tarakhshaqūn, meaning \"bitter herb\". The Arabic term is possibly of Persian origin. Persian polymath Al-Razi used the word tarakhshaqūn in relation to dandelions, chicory, and endives. Al-Razi wrote \"the tarakhshaqūn is like chicory, but more efficacious\"; it is unclear exactly to which plant Al-Raz"

It has been introduced to Malesia, South America, Africa, South East Asia and Australia.The genus name, Tephrosia, derives from the Greek tephros (ash-coloured) and refers to the fact that most of the species are covered with grey hairs. The species epithet, candida, derives from the Latin adjective, candidus,-a,-um, meaning pure white. In Zimbabwe, the use of different taxa of the genus Tephrosia has been studied as a way to enrich soils by intercropping when growing maize. This allows continual nourishment of the soil. Specifically, T. candida was proven to successfully grow in conditions of high population density, yet further research into this growth option is required. To further investigate the genus Tephrosia and its effective growth in stressful habitats, researchers at the University of Zimbabwe studied carbon and nitrogen mineralization patterns of this legume. Mineralization, or the decomposition of organic matter, provides fixed nitrogen for other plants to use. They found that Tephrosia released nitrogen at a slow rate. This pattern could be due to nitrogen binding to polyphenols, or natural organic molecules. This prevents subsequent loss of nitrogen and promotes crop uptake along with nitrogen release. Polyphenol to nitrogen ratios within plants can give evidence toward the quality of biomass and can predict the nitrogen release pattern. While there exist severa"

The tree does not suffer from any major diseases or pests, but it is susceptible to Phyllactinia terminale and rot due to polystictus affinis. The arjuna is seen across the Indian subcontinent, and usually found growing on river banks or near dry river beds in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha and south and central India, Karachi Pakistan along with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It has also been planted in Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya.  The arjuna is one of the species whose leaves are fed on by the Antheraea paphia moth which produces the tassar silk, a wild silk of commercial importance. The arjuna is considered a keystone species in riparian forests of southern India, providing nesting habitat for species including Malabar giant squirrels and critically endangered white-rumped vultures.

William Roxburgh transferred M. bellirica to Terminalia as \"T. bellerica (Gaertn.) Roxb.\". This spelling error is now widely used, causing confusion. The correct name is Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb.The leaves are about 15 cm long and crowded toward the ends of the branches. It is considered a good fodder for cattle. Terminalia bellirica seeds have an oil content of 40%, whose fatty acid methyl ester meets all of the major biodiesel requirements in the US (ASTM D 6751-02, ASTM PS 121-99), Germany (DIN V 51606) and European Union (EN 14214). The seeds are called bedda nuts. The kernels are eaten by the Lodha people of the Indian subcontinent for their mind-altering qualities. The nuts of the tree are rounded but with five flatter sides. It seems that are used as dice in the epic poem Mahabharata and in Rigveda book 10 hymn 34. A handful of nuts would be cast on a gaming board and the players would have to call whether an odd or even number of nuts had been thrown.

In cultivation in English-speaking countries, they are known as Euodia, Evodia, or Bee bee tree. They are attractive trees with deciduous glossy pinnate leaves. Tetradium daniellii (syn. T. hupehensis) develops a smooth gray bark that resembles that of a beech tree and grows to a height of 20 metres (66 ft). The leaves resemble the foliage of an ash tree and are a glossy dark green in summer. In fall there is little color change and leaves tend to drop green to yellow-green. The tree is covered in late July and August with masses of large flat white to gray cluster of small white flowers, particularly valued when few other tree-size plants are flowering. It attracts large numbers of bees and is sought after by beekeepers as a source of late summer honey. The flowers produce clusters of seed that is present from late August through November. The seeds start as bright red capsules that when fully ripe open to expose shiny black buckshot seed as Autumn progresses. The small, red-to-black berries are popular with many birds. Tetradium species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Aenetus scotti and Endoclita damor. The genus is also closely related to Melicope and is so"

The fruit is usually used, denoted sometimes as fructus. It has a strong bitter taste, and is used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and is a recognized herb in Kampo. Both the former genus name and the species name are often misspelled, and the plant usually appears in sources dealing with traditional Chinese medicine as \"Evodia(e) rutaecarpa\". Tetradium ruticarpum is grown mainly in China. The fruit is picked. It may be consumed as food.  In traditional Chinese medicine the herb is described as a fruit. Tetradium ruticarpum is called 呉茱萸 (Goshuyu) in Japanese, used in Goshuyu-tou and Unkentou (ja:温経湯). These are Kampo (漢方) preparations of mixed herbs, the former named after this plant. The mixture is noted for having a high concentration (132.6 to 706.3 mmol/100 g) of antioxidants, where the other constituents of the mixture rank lower. Allergic reactions have occasionally been reported in users of medicinal preparations of the plant. There has been relatively little scientific study of Tetradium ruticarpum except for antioxidant capacity of one of its mixtures. Notable compounds in T. ruticarpum include: alkaloids: rutecarpine, an indole alkaloid that is a COX-2 inhibitor 0-hydroxyrutaecarpine evodiamine, a possible thermogenic agent and stimulant, named after the former name of the genus dehydroevodiamine synephrine, an adrenergic recep"

Although the tree is native to the tropics of the Americas, the largest producer of cocoa beans in 2022 was Ivory Coast. The plants leaves are alternate, entire, unlobed, 10–50 cm (4–20 in) long and 5–10 cm (2–4 in) broad. The flowers are produced in clusters directly on the trunk and older branches; this is known as cauliflory. The flowers are small, 1–2 cm (3⁄8–13⁄16 in) diameter, with pink calyx. The floral formula, used to represent the structure of a flower using numbers, is ✶ K5 C5 A(5°+52) G(5). While many of the world's flowers are pollinated by bees (Hymenoptera) or butterflies/moths (Lepidoptera), cacao flowers are pollinated by tiny flies, Forcipomyia biting midges. Using the natural pollinator Forcipomyia midges produced more fruit than using artificial pollinators. The fruit, called a cacao pod, is ovoid, 15–30 cm (6–12 in) long and 8–10 cm (3–4 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighs about 500 g (1 lb) when ripe. The pod contains 20 to 60 seeds, usually called \"beans\", embedded in a white pulp. The seeds are the main ingredient of chocolate, while the pulp is used in some countries to prepare juice, smoothies, jelly, and cream. Usually discarded until practices changed in the 21st century, the fermented pulp may be distilled into an alcohol"

The name may also allude to the plant's toxicity being comparable to the venom of a rattlesnake. The specific epithet thevetia commemorates André de Thevet (1516–1590), a French Franciscan priest and explorer who explored Brazil and Guiana (where the plant is known as chapéu-de-napoleão, i.e. \"Napoleon's hat\"). Cascabela thevetia is an evergreen tropical shrub or small tree. Its leaves are willow-like, linear-lanceolate, and glossy green in color. They are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss (typical of oleanders). Its stem is green and turns silver/gray as it ages. Flowers bloom from summer to fall. The long, funnel-shaped, sometimes fragrant yellow (less commonly apricot, sometimes white) flowers are in few-flowered terminal clusters. Its fruit is deep red-black in color, encasing a large seed that bears some resemblance to a 'Chinese lucky nut.' Cascabela thevetia is effectively drought-resistant and tolerant to high temperatures, and hence has been naturalized in various semi-arid regions of India. Its bright yellow flowers are used "

The stalked, opposite leaves, which have a rough surface, are quite variable in shape. They may be triangular or ovate and the margins may be toothed, lobed or entire. Length is up to 200 mm and width is up to 60 mm, which are typically smaller than the very similar T. laurifolia. The blue to mauve flowers are about 8 cm across with a 4 cm long tube that is pale yellow inside. These are followed by pods containing seeds that are ejected several metres upon ripening. Plants also reproduce from segments that are washed down watercourses. With a minimum temperature of 10–13 °C (50–55 °F), this plant is cultivated as a houseplant in temperate regions, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The species has become a serious environmental weed in Australia on disturbed land along watercourses and in the wet tropics where it smothers other vegetation.

It is a low, usually prostrate subshrub forming creeping stems up to 10 cm (4 in) tall. The oval evergreen leaves are up to 8 mm. The strongly scented flowers are either lilac, pink-purple, magenta, up to 6 mm long and produced in clusters. The species is native to most of Europe and North Africa. The hardy plant tolerates some pedestrian traffic and produces odors ranging from heavily herbal to lightly lemon, depending on the variety.Wild thyme is a creeping dwarf evergreen shrub, growing to 10 centimetres (4 in) tall. It has woody stems up to 10 cm long and a taproot. It forms matlike plants that root from the nodes of the squarish, limp stems. The leaves are 3–8 mm long in opposite pairs, nearly stalkless, with linear elliptic round-tipped blades and untoothed margins. The plant sends up erect flowering shoots in summer. The flowers are 4–6 mm long and usually pink or mauve, rarely white, with a tube-like calyx and an irregular straight-tubed, hairy corolla. The upper petal is notched and the lower one is larger than the two lateral petals and has three flattened lobes which form a lip. Each flower has four projecting stamens and two fused carpels. The fruit is a dry, four-chambered schizocarp. The oils of T. serpyllum contain thymol, carvacrol, limonene, paracymene, gamma-terpinene "

It is useful in the garden as groundcover, where it can be short-lived, but is easily propagated from cuttings. It is also the main source of thyme as an ingredient in cooking and as a herbal medicine. It is slightly spicier than oregano and sweeter than sage. The Latin specific epithet vulgaris means “common” in the sense of “widespread”.Numerous cultivars and hybrids have been developed for ornamental purposes. Nomenclature can be very confusing. French, German and English varieties vary by leaf shape and colour and essential oils. The many cultivars include 'Argenteus' (silver thyme).

The species is currently treated as a species of Hymenaea, though a few authors isolate it into a separate monospecific genus Trachylobium as Trachylobium verrucosum. It has formerly also been called Trachylobium hornemannianum. Copal resin from Hymenaea verrucosa is used in incense. By the 18th century, Europeans found it to be a valuable ingredient in making a good wood varnish, and it became widely used in the manufacture of furniture and carriages. It was also sometimes used as a picture varnish. By the late 19th and early 20th century, varnish manufacturers in England and America were using it on train carriages, greatly swelling its demand. In 1859, Americans consumed 68 percent of the East African trade, which was controlled through the Sultan of Zanzibar, with Germany receiving 24 percent. The American Civil War and the creation of the Suez Canal led to Germany, India and Hong Kong taking the majority by the end of that century.Media related to Hymenaea verrucosa at Wikimedia Commons"

They have a bitter and pungent taste, with a flavor similar to anise and oregano. They smell like thyme because they also contain thymol, but they are more aromatic and less subtle in taste, as well as being somewhat bitter and pungent. Even a small number of fruits tend to dominate the flavor of a dish. Ajwain grows in dry, barren soil in its indigenous regions of India, Iran, Afghanistan, and parts of northern Africa. Gujarat and Rajasthan are regions in India well-known for cultivating ajwain. The fruits are rarely eaten raw; they are commonly dry-roasted or fried in ghee (clarified butter). This allows the spice to develop a more subtle and complex aroma.

These last two names are also applied to other species. It grows wild in many places and is one of the most widely known species of the salsify genus, Tragopogon. It is cultivated for its ornamental flower and edible root.The plant grows to 1.2 m (4 ft) in height. As with other Tragopogon species, its stem is largely unbranched and the leaves are somewhat grasslike, up to 30 cm (12 in) long. It exudes a milky juice from the stems. The taproots can become 15–30 cm (6–12 in) long and 2–5 cm (3⁄4–2 in) thick. It typically flowers from June to September, but in warmer areas such as California it can be found in bloom from April. The flower head is purple and 5–7.5 cm (2–3 in) across and each is surrounded by 8–9 tapered bracts which are longer than the petals (technically, the ligules of the ray flowers). The flowers are hermaphroditic and pollinated by insects. The fruits are beaked achenes, rod-shaped with light ribs. They have hairs at one end that facilitate wind dispersal. The achenes are 10–17 mm long and 1–3 mm wide without counting the beak, which is up to 55 mm in length. When the fruits are formed fully, the hairs from the fruits give the appearance of a ball of fluff which gives the plant its name \"goatsbeard\". Tragopogon pratensis has similar but smaller flowers.

Other vernacular names include buffalo nut, bat nut, devil pod, ling nut, mustache nut, singhara nut, water nut, and water chestnut, though this last name is commonly applied to Eleocharis dulcis. It is a floating annual aquatic plant, growing in slow-moving freshwater up to 5 metres (16 feet) deep, native to warm temperate parts of Eurasia and Africa. It bears horned fruits. Each fruit contains a single large seed. T. natans has been cultivated in China and the Indian subcontinent for the edible seeds for at least 3,000 years. In feudal Japan, the fruits were used as substitutes for iron caltrops, an area denial weapon; they were sharp enough to penetrate the shoes of the period. The Japanese manufacturing group Mitsubishi takes its name and its logo from the plant. The Bengali name for the samosa or fried triangular pastry snack, shingara, is likewise the name of the plant.Trapa natans forms floating leaf rosettes up to about 50 cm (20 in) across. It grows as an annual plant in shallow, slow-flowing fresh water, with a submerged stem up to some 2 m (7 ft) long and up to 6 mm (0.24 in) thick, rooted in the bottom mud and bearing thin leaves. The surface leaves are diamond-shaped, toothed, and up to 5 cm (2 in) long and 6 cm (2.5 in) wide. Their petioles (leaf stalks) are up to 21 cm (8.3 in) long.

It has been unintentionally introduced to North America and Australia. An aggressive and hardy invasive species, T. terrestris is widely known as a noxious weed because of its small woody fruit – the bur – having long sharp and strong spines which easily penetrate surfaces, such as bare feet or thin shoes of crop workers and other pedestrians, the rubber of bicycle tires, and the mouths and skin of grazing animals.Like many weedy species, this plant has numerous common names according to the world region, including 3-corner-jack, goathead, bull's head, gopher-head, caltrop, cat-head, devil's eyelashes, devil's-thorn, devil's-weed, puncturevine, and tackweed. Tribulus terrestris is a taprooted herbaceous plant that grows as a summer annual in temperate climates.

In 1810, Robert Brown transferred it into Trichodesma, but this was retained only until 1882, when Ferdinand von Mueller transferred it into Pollichia. In 1891, Otto Kuntze transferred it into Boraginella, and in 1898 William Philip Hiern transferred it into Borraginoides. Despite these many later transfers, it is Brown's placement that is currently accepted. Three varieties are recognised: T. zeylanicum var. grandiflorum T. zeylanicum var. latisepalum T. zeylanicum var. zeylanicum It is fairly widespread in Australia, occurring in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. == References =="

The plant reaches 45 to 75 cm (18 to 30 in) tall with erect or ascending stems, the growth habit resembling red clover. The leaves are trifoliate, with slender leaflets. The flowers are white to creamy white, produced in inflorescences similar to those of white clover with around 100 flowers.Egyptian clover is cultivated mostly in irrigated sub-tropical regions, and used as leguminous crop. It is an important winter crop in Egypt, where it may have been cultivated since ancient times, and was introduced into northern India in the early nineteenth century. It is also grown in northern Africa west of its native range, and in Australia, China, Europe and the United States, and is locally naturalised north to England. There are two agricultural cultivar groups of berseem clover, single-cut and multi-cut. Single-cut cultivars, like 'Balady', feature a high growing point and have poor recovery once harvested. Multi-cut cultivars, like 'Frosty', feature a lower growing point allowing for multiple harvests from a single sowing. It is generally frost-sensitive and should be planted only after potential for frost has passed. The exception is 'Frosty' berseem clover which was developed by Grassland Oregon, Inc. and released in 2016. This variety is capable of surviving temperatures as low as −15 °C (5 °F).

It is native to the Old World, but planted and naturalised in many other regions.Red clover is a herbaceous, short-lived perennial plant, which is generally variable in size, growing to 20–80 cm (8–31 in) tall. It has a deep taproot which makes it tolerant to drought and gives it a good soil structuring effect. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate (with three leaflets), each leaflet 15–30 mm (5⁄8–1+1⁄8 in) long and 8–15 mm (3⁄8–5⁄8 in) broad, green with a characteristic pale crescent in the outer half of the leaf; the petiole is 1–4 cm (1⁄2–1+1⁄2 in) long, with two basal stipules that are abruptly narrowed to a bristle-like point. The flowers are dark pink with a paler base, 12–15 mm (1⁄2–5⁄8 in) long, produced in a dense inflorescence, and are mostly visited by bumblebees. Trifolium pratense was initially published by Carl Linnaeus in his book Species Plantarum in 1753. The genus has 3 known subspecies: Trifolium pratense subsp. baeticum (Boiss.)

It is native to Europe, including the British Isles, and central Asia and is one of the most widely cultivated types of clover. It has been widely introduced worldwide as a forage crop, and is now also common in most grassy areas (lawns and gardens) of North America, Australia and New Zealand. The species includes varieties often classed as small, intermediate and large, according to height, which reflects petiole length. The term 'white clover' is applied to the species in general, 'Dutch clover' is often applied to intermediate varieties (but sometimes to smaller varieties), and 'ladino clover' is applied to large varieties.The genus name, Trifolium, derives from the Latin tres, \"three\", and folium, \"leaf\", so called from the characteristic form of the leaf, which almost always has three leaflets (trifoliolate); hence the popular name \"trefoil\". The species name, repens, is Latin for \"creeping\". It is a herbaceous, perennial plant. It is low growing, with flowering heads of whitish florets, often with a tinge of pink or cream that may come on with the aging of the plant. The heads are generally 1.5–2 centimetres (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) wide, and are at the end of 7 centimetres (2+3⁄4 in) peduncles or inflorescence stalks.

It is cultivated worldwide as a semiarid crop. Its leaves and seeds are common ingredients in dishes from the Indian subcontinent, and have been used as a culinary ingredient since ancient times. Its use as a food ingredient in small quantities is safe. Although a common dietary supplement, no significant clinical evidence suggests that fenugreek has therapeutic properties. Commonly used in traditional medicine, fenugreek can increase the risk of serious adverse effects, including allergic reactions.Fenugreek is believed to have been brought into cultivation in the Near East. Which wild strain of the genus Trigonella gave rise to domesticated fenugreek is uncertain. Charred fenugreek seeds have been recovered from Tell Halal, Iraq (carbon dated to 4000 BC), Bronze Age levels of Lachish, and desiccated seeds from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Cato the Elder lists fenugreek with clover and vetch as crops grown to feed cattle. In one first-century AD recipe, the Romans flavoured wine with fenugreek. In the 1st century AD, in Galilee, it was grown as a staple food, as Josephus mentions in his book, the Wars of the Jews. The plant is mentioned in the second-century compendium of Jewish Oral Law (Mishnah) under its Hebrew name tiltan.

Triphasias are very close relatives of citrus.It is a spiny evergreen shrub (rarely a small tree), growing to 3 m tall. The leaves are trifoliate, glossy dark green, each leaflet 2–4 cm long and 1.5–2 cm broad. The flowers are white, with three petals 10–13 mm long and 4 mm broad. The fruit is a red, edible hesperidium 10–15 mm diameter, similar to a small Citrus fruit. The fruit flesh is pulpy, with a flavor reminiscent of a slightly sweet lime. It is grown for its edible fruit, and has been widely introduced to other subtropical to tropical regions of the world; it has become naturalized on a number of islands in the tropical Pacific Ocean. It has also been noted as a potential invasive in several Indian Ocean archipelagos, and along the United States Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas as well as in the Caribbean. The limeberry has gained some popularity as a bonsai plant. More tropical than true citrus, it must be kept in greenhouses even in many locations where true citrus thrive.

The name \"tussilago\" is derived from the Latin tussis, meaning cough, and ago, meaning to cast or to act on. It has had uses in traditional medicine, but the discovery of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the plant has resulted in liver health concerns. Tussilago farfara is the only accepted species in the genus Tussilago, although more than two dozen other species have at one time or another been considered part of this group. Most of them are now regarded as members of other genera (Chaptalia, Chevreulia, Farfugium, Homogyne, Leibnitzia, Petasites, Senecio).Coltsfoot is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by seeds and rhizomes. Tussilago is often found in colonies of dozens of plants. The flowers, which superficially resemble dandelions, bear scale-leaves on the long stems in early spring. The leaves of coltsfoot, which appear after the flowers have set seed, wither and die in the early summer. The flower heads are of yellow florets with an outer row of bracts. The plant is typically 10–30 cm (3.9–11.8 in) in height. The leaves have angular teeth on their margins. Coltsfoot is widespread across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, from Svalbard to Morocco to China and the Russian Far East.

It occurs throughout the Tropics.An erect annual herb that can be easily distinguished by the cup-shaped involucre that surrounds the small flowers in the catkin-like inflorescence. It can grow up to 1.2 m (3.9 ft) tall in favorable circumstances, but is usually smaller. The leaves are broad ovate, 1.2 cm–6.5 cm × 1 cm–4 cm (0.47 in–2.56 in × 0.39 in–1.57 in). The leaf base is rounded to shortly attenuate. The leaf margin is basally 5-nerved and is crenate-serrate with an acute or obtuse apex. The petiole is 1.5–5.5 cm (0.59–2.17 in) long. The flower spikes are axillary, 2.5–6 cm (0.98–2.36 in) long, monoecious, with a rachis terminating in a triradiate hood. The tiny male flowers are white-green, located on the upper part of the flower spikes, and are ebracteate, minute, and clustered with vermiculiform anthers. The pollens are roughly round and approximately 10–12 microns in diameter. The green female flowers are located lower on the spikes, and are subtended by 3–7 mm (0.12–0.28 in) long suborbicular-cuneiform, many-nerved, toothed bracts that are foliaceous.

It belongs to the \"crows and tigers\", that is, the Danainae group of the brush-footed butterflies family. The butterfly is also called striped tiger in India to differentiate it from the equally common plain tiger, Danaus chrysippus. The species was first described by Pieter Cramer in 1779.The butterfly closely resembles the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) of the Americas. The wingspan is 70 to 95 millimetres (2.8 to 3.7 in). Both sexes of the butterfly have tawny wings with veins marked with broad black bands. The male has a pouch on the hindwing. The margins of the wings are black with two rows of white spots. The underside of the wings resembles the upperside but is paler in colouration. The male common tiger has a prominent black-and-white spot on the underside of the hindwing. In drier regions the tawny part of the hindwing pales and approaches white in colour making it very similar to the white tiger (D. melanippus). D. genutia is distributed throughout India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and extending to South-East Asia and Australia (except New Guinea). At least in the South Asian part of its range it is fairly common, locally very common. This butterfly occurs in scrub jungles, fallow land adjacent to habitation, dry and moist deciduous forests, preferring areas of moderate to heavy rainfall.

The flowers, which appear in spring before the leaves, are borne in racemes on a leafless stem (scape) up to 60 cm long. The flowers are widely spaced on the raceme, which is 15–31 cm long, and are carried on stalks (pedicels) 2.5–4 cm long. Individual flowers are bell-shaped. The six pale brown tepals have white margins. The 6–7 cm long stamens have yellow anthers and filaments which are flattened at the base. Between six and nine seeds are produced in a capsule which is 1.5–1.8 cm long. Individual seeds are black and shaped like flattened ellipsoids. D. indica ranges through the Indian subcontinent, from Pakistan and the Himalayas to Sri Lanka, and eastwards to Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The species is divided into six subspecies, five of which have many hollow stinging hairs called trichomes on the leaves and stems, which act like hypodermic needles, injecting histamine and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation upon contact (\"contact urticaria\", a form of contact dermatitis). The plant has a long history of use as a source for traditional medicine, food, tea, and textile raw material in ancient (such as Saxon) and modern societies.Urtica dioica is a dioecious, herbaceous, and perennial plant. It grows to 0.9 to 2 metres (3 to 7 feet) tall in the summer and dying down to the ground in winter. It has widely spreading rhizomes and stolons, which are bright yellow, as are the roots. The soft, green leaves are 3 to 20 centimetres (1 to 6 in) long and are borne oppositely on an erect, wiry, green stem. The leaves have a strongly serrated margin, a cordate base, and an acuminate tip with a terminal leaf tooth longer than adjacent laterals.

Many species have stinging hairs and may be called nettles or stinging nettles (the latter name applying particularly to U. dioica). The generic name Urtica derives from the Latin for 'sting'. Due to the stinging hairs, Urtica are rarely eaten by herbivores, but provide shelter for insects. The fiber has historically been used by humans, and cooking preparations exist.Urtica species grow as annuals or perennial herbaceous plants, rarely shrubs. They can reach, depending on the type, location and nutrient status, a height of 10–300 centimetres (4–118 inches). The perennial species have underground rhizomes. The green parts have stinging hairs. Their often quadrangular stems are unbranched or branched, erect, ascending or spreading. Most leaves and stalks are arranged across opposite sides of the stem. The leaf blades are elliptic, lanceolate, ovate or circular. The leaf blades usually have three to five, rarely up to seven veins. The leaf margin is usually serrate to more or less coarsely toothed. The often-lasting bracts are free or fused to each other. The cystoliths are extended to more or less rounded. In 1874, while in Collioure (south of France), French botanist Charles Naudin discovered that a strong wind lasting 24 hours rendered the stinging hairs of nettles harmless for an entire week.

The plants first form a dense rosette of leaves at ground level, subsequently sending up a tall flowering stem. Biennial plants form the rosette the first year and the stem the following season. The leaves are spirally arranged, often densely hairy, though glabrous (hairless) in some species. The flowers have five symmetrical petals; petal colours in different species include yellow (most common), orange, red-brown, purple, blue, or white. The fruit is a capsule containing numerous minute seeds. In gardening and landscaping, the mulleins are valued for their tall narrow stature and for flowering over a long period of time, even in dry soils.

It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, and has become invasive in temperate world regions. It is a minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently. Although commonly used in traditional medicine, no approved drugs are made from this plant.

Some species are edible and of economic value. They are known for having intense purple flowers. There have been numerous distinct subgenera and subsections named in this genus, and some botanists have divided the genus into several distinct genera. For instance, the Flora of North America recognizes only about twenty species in Vernonia sensu stricto, seventeen of which are in North America north of Mexico, with the others being found in South America.The genus was circumscribed by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in Gen. Pl. ed. 8[a]. vol.2 on page 541 in 1791. The genus name of Vernonia is in honour of William Vernon (1666/67 – c. 1711), who was an English plant collector, (bryologist) and entomologist from Cambridge University, who collected in Maryland, USA in 1698. Species of this genus are found in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and North America. Vernonia species are well known for hybridizing between similar species in areas of overlapping ranges. There are approximately 350 species in the genus. A selected list is given below.

These flower spikes arise from the stem where leaves emerge. The leaves are opposite, rather elongated and pointed at the tip, clasping the stem, and serrate-toothed in the end half, except for the lowermost that are often stalked and lacking in teeth. Aside from reproducing by seeds, the plant sends out rooting branches that spread it vegetatively early in its growth, whilst its main stems curve along the ground rooting before rising upwards to flower, and in floods pieces will break off and root further downstream. Important identification characteristics of V. anagallis-aquatica are: flower colour (purply-blue), bracts (usually much shorter than the flower stalk, and narrow), fruit (somewhat elongated), sepals (not spreading wide open on fruiting), fruiting stalks (base not spreading at a very wide angle) and leaves (somewhat broadish, and lowest stalked).

It has smooth spreading succulent branches that are often reddish, blunt oblong finely serrate leaves in opposite pairs close to the stem, and small bright blue or pink flowers with four petals. The specific name beccabunga has a common origin with bäckebunga, an archaic Swedish name for the plant used at the time when it was described by Carl Linnaeus. Names with the same origin are still in use in other European languages, including beekpunge In Dutch, and bachbunge in German (meaning 'brook bunch', or 'brook pouch').Brooklime was one of three traditional antiscorbutic herbs (alongside scurvy grass and watercress), used in purported remedies for scurvy. However, none of these herbs are rich in vitamin C and the usual preparation by extracting of juices would have destroyed most of their content, rendering the preparations ineffectual against true scurvy. However, they are plants that last into the winter, past the first frosts, and may well have been one of the few sources of vitamin C when eaten as a winter salad.

Vetiver is most closely related to sorghum while sharing many morphological characteristics with other fragrant grasses, such as lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus), citronella (Cymbopogon nardus, C. winterianus), and palmarosa (Cymbopogon martinii).Vetiver is derived from the Tamil வெட்டிவேர் (veṭṭivēr) meaning 'root that is dug up', via French vétyver. In Northern India it is also called khus ('grass', not to be confused with khus khus, which refers to poppy seed). During the reign of Harshavardhan, Kannauj became the biggest centre for aromatic trade and for the first time, a vetiver tax was introduced. Starting in 1990, the World Bank promoted use of vetiver grass by farmers for soil and water management in countries like India, Nepal, Thailand, and Nigeria. Vetiver grows to 150 centimetres (5 ft) high and forms clumps as wide, and under favorable conditions, the erect culms can reach 3 m (9.8 ft) in height. The stems are tall and the leaves are long, thin, and rather rigid. The flowers are brownish-purple. Unlike most grasses, which form horizontally, spreading mat-like root systems, vetiver's roots grow downward 2–4 m (7–13 ft) in depth. The vetiver bunch grass has a gregarious habit and grows in tufts. Shoots growing from the underground crown make the plant frost and wildfire resistant, and allow it to survive heavy grazing pressure. The leaves can become up to 3"

The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.The generic name Viburnum originated in Latin, in which it referred to V. lantana. The leaves are opposite, simple, and entire, with toothed or lobed margins. Cool temperate species are deciduous, while most of the warm temperate species are evergreen. Some species have densely hairy shoots and leaves covered in star-shaped hairs. Almost all species have stipules on petioles, except tropical species found in Malesia. The flowers are produced in corymbs 5–15 cm across. Each flower is white, cream or pink, small (3–5 mm across), and has five petals. Some species are strongly fragrant. The gynoecium has three connate carpels with the nectary located at the top of the gynoecium. Some species also have a fringe of large, showy sterile flowers around the perimeter of the corymb, serving as a pollinator target.

Some people suffer from favism, a hemolytic response to the consumption of broad beans, a condition linked to a metabolic disorder known as G6PDD. Otherwise the beans, with the outer seed coat removed, can be eaten raw or cooked. With young seed pods, the outer seed coat can be eaten, and in very young pods, the entire seed pod can be eaten.Vicia faba is a stiffly erect, annual plant 0.5 to 1.8 metres (1+1⁄2 to 6 ft) tall, with two to four stems that are square in cross-section.

It is now naturalised throughout the world occurring on every continent, except Antarctica and the Arctic. The centre of diversity is thought to be the Fertile Crescent, although gold standard molecular confirmation is currently not available. Global common vetch cultivation is limited due to anti-nutritional compounds in the seed although it is grown in dryland agricultural zones in Australia, China and Ethiopia due to its drought tolerance and very low nutrient requirements compared to other legumes. In these agricultural zones common vetch is grown as a green manure, livestock fodder or rotation crop. In cultivated grainfields, like lentils, it is often considered a weed due to downgrading of harvested mixed grain, resulting in farmers receiving less financial returns.Vicia sativa is a sprawling annual herb, with hollow, four-sided, hairless to sparsely hairy stems which can reach two meters in maximum length. The leaves are stipulate, alternate and compound, each made up of 3–8 opposite pairs of linear, lance-shaped, oblong, or wedge-shaped, needle-tipped leaflets up to 35 millimeters (1+1⁄2 in) long. Each compound leaf ends in a branched tendril. The pea-like flowers occur in the leaf axils, solitary or in pairs.

Yellow flowers on its hairy and densely packed branches develop into yellow-brown pods, 2 to 3 inches in length. The seeds of these pods contain approximately 22–24% protein. The pods, sprouts and protein-rich seeds of this crop are commonly consumed in India. Moth bean can be grown on many soil types, and can also act as a pasture legume. Due to its drought-resistant qualities, its ability to combat soil erosion and its high protein content, moth bean has been identified as possibly a more significant food source in the future. It has been suggested that its suitability as a grain legume in semi-arid Africa should be further investigated.Taxonomically moth bean belongs to the family Fabaceae (subfamily Papilionoideae), and genus Vigna.

The inflorescence is a few-flowered raceme, with the peduncle being 2–22.5 cm (0.79–8.86 in) long, the pedicels 1–2.5 mm (0.039–0.098 in) long, and the calyx 2.5 mm (0.098 in) long and glabrous, with minute teeth. The corolla is yellow and 5–7 mm 5–7 cm (2.0–2.8 in) long. The pods are cylindrical, 1.5–5 cm (0.59–1.97 in) long and 2.5–3 mm (0.098–0.118 in) wide, from glabrous to sparingly pubescent with short adpressed hairs, and are black when ripe. Vigna trilobata is mostly found on well-drained, alkaline, dark, cracking clay soils, but also on sandy and loamy soils of similar reaction and can rarely be found on poorly drained soils. One of its major features is its strong resistance to drought, though the seeds shatter in frost. It is also moderately tolerant of salinity. Un"

    "knowledge_text": "Vigna umbellata, previously Phaseolus calcaratus, is a warm-season annual vine legume with yellow flowers and small edible beans. It is commonly called ricebean or rice bean. To date, it is little known, little researched, and little exploited. It is regarded as a minor food and fodder crop and is often grown as intercrop or mixed crop with maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or cowpea (V. unguiculata), as well as a sole crop in the uplands, on a very limited area. Like the other Asiatic Vigna species, ricebean is a fairly short-lived warm-season annual. Grown mainly as a dried pulse, it is also important as a fodder, a green manure and a vegetable. Ricebean is most widely grown as an intercrop, particularly of maize, throughout Indo-China and extending into southern China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the past it was widely grown as lowland crop on residual soil water after the harvest of long-season rice, but it has been displaced to a great extent where shorter duration rice varieties are grown. Ricebean grows well on a range of soils. It establishes rapidly and has the potential to produce large amounts of nutritious animal fodder and high quality grain.The cultivated Asiatic Vigna species belong to the sub-genus Ceratotropis, a fairly distinct and homogeneous group, largely restricted to Asia, which has a chromosome number of 2n = 22 (except V. glabrescens, 2n = 44). There are seven cultivated species within the sub-genus, including mung bean or green gram (V."

A high level of morphological diversity is found within the species with large variations in the size, shape, and structure of the plant. Four subspecies are recognised, three of which are cultivated. Its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall have made it an important crop in the semiarid regions across Africa and Asia. It was domesticated in Africa and is one of the oldest crops to be farmed. A second domestication event probably occurred in Asia, before they spread into Europe and the Americas. Most cowpeas are grown on the African continent, particularly in Nigeria and Niger, which account for 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on 12.5 millionhectares (31 millionacres) of land, have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint to the production of cowpea, sometimes causing over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main preharvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main postharvest pest. It requires very few inputs, as the plant's root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource-poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops.

It is native to Eurasia, where it grows in moist woodland. It is a wild relative of onion and garlic, all belonging to the same genus, Allium. There are two recognized subspecies: A. ursinum subsp. ursinum and A. ursinum subsp. ucrainicum.The Latin specific name ursinum translates to 'bear' and refers to the supposed fondness of the brown bear for the bulbs; folk tales describe the bears consuming them after awakening from hibernation. Another theory is that the \"ursinum\" may refer to Ursa Major, as A. ursinum was perhaps one of the most northerly distributed Allium species known to the ancient Greeks, though this hypothesis is disputed. Common names for the plant in many languages also make reference to bears. Cows love to eat them, hence the modern vernacular name of cows's leek. In Devon, dairy farmers have occasionally had the milk of their herds rejected because of the garlic flavour imparted to it by the cows having grazed upon the plant. Ramsons is from the Old English word hramsa, meaning \"garlic\". There is evidence it has been used in British cuisine since the Celtic Britons over 1,500 years ago.

Violas are slightly larger than violins, and have a lower sound. Since the 18th century, it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth higher) and the cello (which is tuned an octave lower). The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3, G3, D4, and A4. In the past, the viola varied in size and style, as did its names. The word viola originates from the Italian language. The Italians often used the term viola da braccio, meaning, literally, 'of the arm'. \"Brazzo\" was another Italian word for the viola, which the Germans adopted as Bratsche. The French had their own names: cinquiesme was a small viola, haute contre was a large viola, and taile was a tenor. Today, the French use the term alto, a reference to its range. The viola was popular in the heyday of five-part harmony, up until the eighteenth century, taking three lines of the harmony and occasionally playing the melody line. Music notation for the viola differs from most other instruments in that it primarily uses the alto clef. When viola music has substantial sections in a higher register, it switches to the treble clef to make it easier to read. The viola often plays the \"inner voices\" in string quartets and symphonic writing, and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts. The viola occas"

The flowers are produced in late spring to early summer, 10 to 15 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) diameter, pale bluish or yellowish-white with a short, greenish or yellowish spur. The petals are rounded and broad in relation to their width. Viola elatior occurs in native to central and northern Europe and northern Asia. Its habitat is confined to very local damp, lime-rich places, in long herbage (fens and limy marshes). The plant is fussy about where it grows; seeds germinates in the spring on moist bare patches of base-rich peaty soil, but the seedlings only become established if the soil surface becomes drier. Most seeds germinate in close proximity to the parent plant so dispersal is limited. Habitat disturbance may cause the violet to disappear from a former habitat, but the seeds are very long-lived and new plants sometimes appear many years later. In the British Isles, it is rare, confined to eastern and northern England and damp hollows with limestone soils in western Ireland.

Vitex is a cross-pollinating plant, but its self-pollination has been recorded. Theophrastus mentioned the shrub several times, as ágnos (ἄγνος) in Enquiry into Plants. It has been long believed to be an anaphrodisiac – leading to its name as \"chaste tree\" – but its effectiveness for such action remains unproven. The shrub was utilized for religious rituals in ancient Greece and among the Philistines in modern-day Israel.Vitex, its name in Pliny the Elder, is derived from the Latin vieo, meaning to weave or to tie up, a reference to the use of V. agnus-castus in basketry. Its macaronic specific name agnus-castus repeats \"chaste\" in both Greek and Latin; the small tree was considered to be sacred to the virginal goddess Hestia/Vesta. The most common names are \"chaste tree\", \"vitex\", and \"monk's pepper\". Vitex agnus-castus is widely cultivated in warm, temperate, and subtropical regions for its delicately textured, aromatic foliage and butterfly-attracting midsummer spikes of lavender flowers opening in late summer in cooler climates.

As of 2012, there were between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of Vitis vinifera grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production. The wild grape is sometimes classified as Vitis vinifera var. sylvestris (in some classifications considered Vitis sylvestris), with Vitis vinifera var vinifera restricted to cultivated forms. Domesticated vines have hermaphrodite flowers, but V. vinifera var. sylvestris is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants) and pollination is required for fruit to develop. Grapes can be eaten fresh or dried to produce raisins, sultanas, and currants. Grape leaves are used in the cuisine of many cultures. The fresh grapes can also be processed into juice that is fermented to make wine and vinegar. Cultivars of Vitis vinifera form the basis of the majority of wines produced around the world. All of the familiar wine varieties belong to Vitis vinifera, which is cultivated on every continent except for Antarctica, and in all the major wine regions of the world. Changes in pip (seed) shape (narrower in domesticated forms) and distribution suggest that domestication occurred about 4100–3000 BC, in southwest Asia, South Caucasus (Armenia and Georgia), or the Western Black Sea shore region (B"

W. somnifera is a short shrub 35–75 cm (14–30 in) tall with tomentose branches, dull green elliptic leaves up to 10–12 cm (3.9–4.7 in) long, small green bell-shaped flowers, and orange-red ripe fruit. It is affected by various pests and diseases in India, which can damage plant health and reduce its secondary metabolite content. The plant, particularly its root powder, has been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine. W. somnifera is commonly sold as a dietary supplement containing root or leaf powder or extracts. It is undergoing research for potential effects on stress, anxiety, and sleep, but current clinical evidence is insufficient to confirm its safety or efficacy. The primary phytochemicals in W. somnifera are withanolides—structurally similar to ginsenosides in Panax ginseng—along with alkaloids and sitoindosides, leading to its nickname, Indian ginseng. W. somnifera is generally well tolerated for up to about three months with mostly mild side effects. It should be avoided during pregnancy or in people with hormone-sensitive conditions.

It is a small to medium-sized deciduous shrub or tree, ranging from 3–15 m (10–49 ft) in height but also reaching up to 18 m. The bark is smooth, yellowish-brown and about 10 mm thick, producing a milky-white latex. Leaves are simple, oppositely arranged, ovate, obtusely acuminate and are 10–20 cm long and 5 cm wide. Leaves are glabrous and sometimes pubescent beneath. Leaf stalks are very short. The flowers appear (in India) from March to May, peaking from April to June. White flowers appear in corymb-like cymes, 5–15 cm across, at the end of branches. Flowers have five white petals 2–3 cm long which turn creamish yellow as they age. The flowers have oblong petals which are rounded at the tip, and are similar to flowers of frangipani. Fruiting is in August and the fruit is cylindrical, blackish-green speckled with white, long horn-like and united at tip. The seeds are brown and flat with bunch of white hairs.

Some sources claim it originates in southern Europe and Asia, but has been extensively naturalized elsewhere. Others, such as the Flora of China and Flora of North America, state it originates in the Americas but was an early introduction to Eurasia.The species is monoecious, with the flowers borne in separate unisexual heads: staminate (male) heads situated above the pistillate (female) heads in the inflorescence. The pistillate heads consist of two pistillate flowers surrounded by a spiny involucre. Upon fruiting, these two flowers ripen into two brown to black achenes and they are completely enveloped by the involucre, which becomes a bur. The bur, being buoyant, easily disperses in the water for plants growing along waterways. However, the bur, with its hooked projections, is obviously adapted to dispersal via mammals by becoming entangled in their hair. Once dispersed and deposited on the ground, typically one of the seeds germinates and the plants grows out of the bur. The plant may have some medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine in South Asia and traditional Chinese medicine. In Telugu, this plant is called Marula Matangi.

It is naturalized in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Tamaulipas (in northeastern Mexico), West Indies, Hawaii, California, and the southeastern United States from Texas to Georgia. Zeuxine strateumatica is a perennial herb up to 25 cm tall. Leaves are linear or narrowly lanceolate, up to 9 cm long. Flowers are borne in an erect panicle of as many as 50 flowers, each white with a yellow lip. In its natural habitat in Asia, Zeuxine strateumatica grows in grasslands, and along streambanks. In places where it is introduced, it frequently grows in lawns and agricultural fields, and is thus considered a nuisance weed.

It is an herbaceous perennial that grows annual pseudostems (false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves) about one meter tall, bearing narrow leaf blades. The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals with purple edges, and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots. Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal. Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii. Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, arriving in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste. Ginger has been used in traditional medicine in China, India and Japan for centuries, and as a modern dietary supplement. Ginger may offer benefits over placebo for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, but there is no good evidence that it helps with nausea during chemotherapy. It remains uncertain whether ginger is effective for treating any disease. In 2023, world production of ginger was 4.9 million tonnes, led by India with 45%"

The rhizomes of Z. zerumbet are used as food flavoring and appetizers in various cuisines, and the rhizome extracts have been used in herbal medicine.Zingiber zerumbet is a perennial. From autumn until spring it goes dormant above ground as the leafy stems shrivel and die away, leaving the pale brown, creeping stems (rhizomes) at ground level. In the spring, the plant springs up anew. The 10–12 blade-shaped leaves are 15–20 centimetres (6–8 in) long and grow in an alternate arrangement on a thin, upright stem to 1.2 m (4 ft) tall. Among the leafy stems, the conical or club-shaped flower heads burst forth on separate and shorter stalks. These appear in the summer, after the leafy stems have been growing for a while. The flower heads are initially green and are 3 to 10 cm (1+1⁄4 to 4 in) long with overlapping scales, enclosing small yellowish-white flowers that poke out a few at a time. As the flower heads mature, they gradually fill with an aromatic, slimy liquid and turn a brighter red color. The flower stalks usually remain hidden beneath the leaf stalks.

Well known species include the commonly cultivated Ziziphus jujuba (jujube), Ziziphus spina-christi from southwestern Asia, Ziziphus lotus from the Mediterranean region, and ber (Ziziphus mauritiana), which is found from western Africa to India.The genus name is derived via classical Latin from Hellenistic Greek, where it is presumed to have been borrowed from another language, perhaps from zizfum or zizafun, the Persian word for Z. lotus. Ziziphus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Bucculatrix zizyphella, which feeds exclusively on the genus, and Endoclita malabaricus. Species are distributed throughout the world in tropical and warm temperate areas, from rain forests to deserts. Some species are evergreen, others are winter or drought deciduous.
